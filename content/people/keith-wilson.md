# Keith Wilson

Keith Wilson (born 1963) is the 54th Mayor of Portland, Oregon, serving since January 1, 2025.[^1][^2] A businessman and Democratic politician, Wilson ran as a political outsider focused on addressing Portland's homelessness crisis with his campaign promise to end unsheltered homelessness within one year.[^3]

## Background

Wilson was born and raised in North Portland and holds a Bachelor of Science in business administration from Oregon State University and an MBA from the University of Portland.[^4] He was the president and CEO of Titan Freight Systems, a company he formed in 1998 by merging his father's two companies.[^4] Wilson also founded Shelter Portland, a nonprofit organization focused on ending homelessness.[^5]

Before running for mayor, Wilson self-funded trips to cities and countries worldwide to study homelessness solutions. He was a delegate to the 2024 Democratic National Convention and served on the Platform Committee.[^6]

## Election

Wilson announced his candidacy for mayor on June 12, 2024.[^7] His campaign centered on tackling homelessness, crime, and livability issues with care and compassion. He defeated city commissioner Carmen Rubio in the November 2024 election, with most news agencies calling the race on November 6, 2024.[^8][^9]

## Key Housing Actions

### As Mayor (2025-present)

- **City Administrator Appointment**: In December 2025, Wilson appointed [Raymond C. Lee III](/people/raymond-lee) as City Administrator to oversee Portland's day-to-day operations and financial management under the city's new form of government.[^10]

- **Portland Housing Bureau Unspent Funds**: Wilson's administration was responsible for disclosing in February 2026 that the Portland Housing Bureau had accumulated $106 million in unspent housing funds, far exceeding the initially reported $21 million.[^10] The discovery prompted calls for improved financial oversight and questions about how housing funds are managed.

- **Homelessness Focus**: Wilson's central campaign promise was to largely end unsheltered homelessness within a year through increased walk-in emergency shelters in existing churches and other community spaces.[^3][^11]
