- **Portland Housing Bureau Unspent Funds Disclosure (2026)**: In early February 2026, Smith publicly disclosed that the Portland Housing Bureau had found approximately $40 million in unspent funds, doubling from the $21 million initially identified in November 2025.[^1] She received a call from Council President Jamie Dunphy on February 3, 2026, informing her that an additional $21 million was discovered in the bureau's Housing Investment Fund.[^2] Smith expressed serious concerns about financial oversight, stating: "This unexpected discovery raises serious concerns about our financial oversight. I am deeply troubled by the possibility that departments may be withholding vital financial information from the council."[^2] The total ultimately grew to $106 million as City Administrator Raymond Lee conducted a full accounting.[^1]
