Loretta Smith (born 1966) is a member of the Portland City Council representing District 1, serving since January 1, 2025.[^1] A longtime Oregon Democratic politician and businesswoman, Smith previously served as a Multnomah County Commissioner from 2011 to 2018 and worked as a congressional staffer for Senator Ron Wyden for 21 years.[^2][^3]

## Background

Smith was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and holds a Bachelor of Arts from Oregon State University.[^4] After graduating, she joined then-U.S. Representative Ron Wyden's staff, eventually becoming his field representative and remaining on his staff for 21 years.[^2][^4]

In 2019, Smith founded Dream Big Communications, a communications consultancy specializing in coalition building and community improvement.[^5] She has one son, Jordan, born in 1990, whom she raised as a single mother.[^4]

## Political Career

### Multnomah County Commission (2011-2018)

Smith began her own political career by running for Multnomah County Commissioner in 2010, winning the runoff by 26 percentage points.[^6] During her tenure, she focused on investments in programs helping poor youth and served on the Portland Metro Workforce Development Board.[^2][^7] She won reelection in 2014 with little opposition.[^2]

### Portland City Council Campaigns

Due to term limits on the County Commission, Smith ran unsuccessful campaigns for Portland City Council in 2018 and 2020.[^1][^8] In 2020, she came in first place in a crowded special election field but lost narrowly to Dan Ryan in the August runoff.[^8]

She also ran for Oregon's 6th Congressional District in 2022, finishing in fourth place out of nine candidates in the Democratic primary.[^9]

### Portland City Council (2025-present)

Smith successfully won election to the Portland City Council in November 2024 under Portland's new district-based system, assuming office on January 1, 2025.[^1]

## Key Housing Actions

### As City Councilor (2025-present)

- **Portland Housing Bureau Unspent Funds Disclosure (2026)**: In early February 2026, Smith publicly disclosed that the Portland Housing Bureau had found approximately $40 million in unspent funds, doubling from the $21 million initially identified in November 2025.[^10] She received a call from Council President Jamie Dunphy on February 3, 2026, informing her that an additional $21 million was discovered in the bureau's Housing Investment Fund.[^11] Smith expressed serious concerns about financial oversight, stating: "This unexpected discovery raises serious concerns about our financial oversight. I am deeply troubled by the possibility that departments may be withholding vital financial information from the council."[^11] The total ultimately grew to $106 million as City Administrator [Raymond C. Lee III](/people/raymond-lee) conducted a full accounting.[^10]
