# Lamar Wise

Lamar Wise is a Democratic member of the Oregon House of Representatives, representing District 48, which covers parts of East [Portland](/cities/portland), Happy Valley, Damascus, and Boring.[^1] He was appointed to the seat on November 5, 2025, by a joint vote of the Multnomah and Clackamas County Boards of Commissioners following the death of Rep. Hòa Nguyễn.[^2] A labor advocate and community organizer, Wise has named building affordable housing as one of his top legislative priorities.[^3]

Before entering the legislature, Wise served as the political director for AFSCME Oregon Council 75, one of the state's largest unions representing over 40,000 workers.[^4] He previously served as executive director and legislative director of the Oregon Student Association.[^5] Wise holds a Political Science degree from the University of Oregon.[^6]

## Background

Wise grew up in Hillsboro, Oregon, and got his start in political organizing while struggling to afford basic expenses as a student at the University of Oregon.[^7] He began his professional advocacy career at the Oregon Student Association as legislative director in 2015, becoming executive director in 2017.[^8] During his time at OSA, he focused on fighting tuition increases, expanding campus mental health services, and led a voter registration drive that registered 35,000 students in 2018.[^9]

Wise transitioned to Oregon AFSCME as a political coordinator in 2019, eventually rising to political director, where he lobbied for legislation supporting the union's state, local government, behavioral health, and social service workers.[^10] He has served on the boards of multiple organizations connected to housing and social justice, including the Community Alliance of Tenants Action Fund, the ACLU of Oregon, Our Oregon, and the Governor's Racial Council.[^11] He also served on the state's Higher Education Coordinating Commission.[^12]

## Key Housing Actions

### As State Representative (2025-present)

- **Affordable Housing with Union Labor**: Upon his appointment, Wise identified building more affordable housing—specifically using union labor—as his top legislative priority, alongside growing the behavioral health workforce, supporting educators and child care workers, and protecting immigrant communities.[^3]

- **Housing Focus in 2026 Session**: Wise entered the February 2026 short legislative session focused on housing and economic issues facing his district, where families face rising costs for housing and utilities.[^13] The session has included debates over urban growth boundary expansions and other housing-related measures.[^14]

### Prior Advocacy and Board Service

- **Community Alliance of Tenants Action Fund**: Wise served as a board member of the CAT Action Fund, Oregon's only statewide grassroots tenant-rights organization, which advocates for rent stabilization, eviction protections, and safe housing conditions for renters.[^11][^15]

- **Portland Independent District Commission (2023)**: Wise served as one of 13 commissioners on Portland's Independent District Commission, which drew the four geographic districts for Portland's new city council election system.[^16] The commission's work shaped how Portland neighborhoods—including those grappling with housing affordability—would be represented under the city's new form of government.[^17]

- **Oregon AFSCME Advocacy**: As political director at AFSCME Oregon Council 75, Wise advocated for legislation benefiting working families, including measures related to affordable housing, wages, and worker protections.[^4] Oregon AFSCME described him as having "a proven commitment to the labor movement" and someone who "spent his career fighting for and alongside communities of color, young people and working people to increase access to healthcare, education and affordable housing."[^18]
