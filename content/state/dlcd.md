# Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD)

The Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) is the state's chief land-use planning and regulatory agency. DLCD administers Oregon's statewide land use planning program and plays a central role in housing policy through its oversight of local comprehensive plans, zoning regulations, and housing production tracking.

## Overview

DLCD was established in 1973 under Senate Bill 100, which created Oregon's nationally recognized statewide land use planning program.[^1] A seven-member volunteer citizen board known as the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) guides DLCD and adopts administrative rules that local governments must follow.

## Statewide Planning Goals

Oregon's land use system is built on 19 Statewide Planning Goals that address land use, development, housing, transportation, and conservation of natural resources.[^1] All cities and counties must adopt comprehensive plans that meet these mandatory state standards.

Key goals relevant to housing include:

- **Goal 10 (Housing)**: Requires cities to provide for adequate housing types at various price ranges and rent levels
- **Goal 14 (Urbanization)**: Establishes urban growth boundaries (UGBs) to separate urban and rural land

## Role in Housing Policy

DLCD's housing-related responsibilities have expanded significantly in recent years as Oregon has prioritized increasing housing production. Key functions include:

### Housing Production Reporting

Under [HB 2001 (2023)](/legislation/2023/hb-2001), DLCD collects annual housing production reports from Oregon cities with populations of 10,000 or more.[^2] Cities must report both units permitted (building permits issued) and units produced (certificates of occupancy issued).

### Middle Housing Implementation

DLCD developed the administrative rules implementing [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001), which requires cities to allow duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, and cottage clusters in residential zones. DLCD provides technical assistance to local governments updating their development codes to comply with middle housing requirements.

### Housing Production Strategies

Under [HB 2003 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2003), DLCD oversees the requirement for cities to develop Housing Production Strategies that plan for meeting their identified housing needs.

### Climate-Friendly and Equitable Communities

DLCD administers the Climate-Friendly and Equitable Communities (CFEC) program, which requires Oregon's eight largest metropolitan areas to reduce climate pollution from transportation by changing land use patterns to allow more housing near jobs, transit, and services.

## Housing Accountability and Production Office (HAPO)

HAPO is a division within DLCD focused on accelerating housing production and ensuring local government compliance with state housing laws. HAPO works with cities to remove barriers to housing development and can take enforcement action when local governments fail to meet their housing obligations.

## Key Programs

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Housing | Oversees implementation of state housing laws and tracks housing production |
| Urban Planning | Manages urban growth boundaries and comprehensive plan updates |
| Climate-Friendly and Equitable Communities | Land use rules to reduce transportation emissions |
