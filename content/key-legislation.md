# Key Housing Legislation

These are the key pieces of legislation impacting housing affordability in Oregon.

## Senate Bill 100 (1973)

In response to environmental concerns about unrestricted development, Oregon Senate Bill 100 required every city in Oregon to define an Urban Growth Boundary, or a border that constrained its outward expansion, and to also prepare a comprehensive plan in alignment with statewide goals. The Urban Growth Boundary concept is the key constraint to the availability of buildable land.
