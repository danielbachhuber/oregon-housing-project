# Happy Valley

Happy Valley is a city in Clackamas County, Oregon, located approximately 10 miles southeast of downtown [Portland](/cities/portland) in the Portland metropolitan area.[^1] Happy Valley has a 2026 population of 31,404 and is currently growing at a rate of 4.03% annually, with its population having increased by 30.32% since the most recent census, which recorded a population of 24,098 in 2020.[^2] Happy Valley has been one of Oregon's fastest-growing communities for nearly two decades, with a population increase of 594% since 2000.[^3] The city has a total area of 11.965 square miles, and is a member of the Portland metropolitan area, bordering Portland, Clackamas, Damascus, Pleasant Valley, and Sunnyside.[^4] With a median household income of $120,702, Happy Valley is one of the more affluent communities in the region.[^5]

Happy Valley's housing consists of 9,076 units, with 72.4% being detached single-family homes. Attached options, including duplexes and townhouses, make up 10.4%.[^9] The median construction year is 2006, reflecting the city's rapid growth in the 21st century.[^9] 27.9% of homes were added from 2000 to 2009, 33% between 2010 and 2019, and 6.1% are part of the newest wave of development.[^9] In the past 15 years alone, Happy Valley has added 5,744 new housing units, including 1,722 multifamily units.[^3]

## Zoning and Land Use

Happy Valley updated its development code to comply with [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001), which requires cities in the Metro region to allow middle housing types in residential zones. The amendments generally allow townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, or cottage clusters in all residential areas rather than limiting them to a detached single-family dwelling. Prior to the enactment of HB 2001, the City generally limited this type of housing to multifamily zones.[^10]

The City understands many community members are concerned their neighborhood wasn't designed to accommodate greater density. Given the concerns expressed by the community and at the direction of the Planning Commission and City Council, the City of Happy Valley implemented the legislation with as many of the extra requirements as the bill allowed.[^11]

Senate Bill 458 required Happy Valley to allow property owners to subdivide middle housing units (a duplex, townhome, triplex, quadplex, or cottage housing) so that the dwellings may be individually sold or owned with the land below them. The units may not be stacked on each other, and each lot may only contain a single dwelling.[^11]

Happy Valley's history with its urban growth boundary has been contentious. Happy Valley incorporated as a municipality in 1965 to prevent a fate of being annexed into the city of Portland and to protect its character as a small, rural community.[^12] In 1977, most Happy Valley residents opposed a proposal to designate their city as part of the Portland metro area's Urban Growth Boundary. The designation would have forced the city to permit development with an increase in property taxes. In 1978, the Metropolitan Service District included Happy Valley within Portland's UGB.[^12]

The city is now planning for significant expansion through the Pleasant Valley/North Carver Comprehensive Plan. Over 1,000 acres have already been annexed within the project area. The City will continue to welcome additional annexations and new residents in the future.[^13] In 2023, the city council approved plans to annex parts of the Pleasant Valley and North Carver neighborhoods, adding over 1,700 households.[^14]

## Buildable Land

Happy Valley completed a 2020 Buildable Lands Inventory and Housing Capacity Analysis as part of its comprehensive planning process.[^15] The city's planning documents address land supply and development capacity within its urban growth boundary.

The Development Ready Land Inventory study area does not reflect the market realities in Happy Valley where large greenfield developments are often constructed more than 300 feet from existing infrastructure.[^3] The Pleasant Valley/North Carver area represents the city's primary growth area, with significant annexation activity underway.

Key constraints on remaining buildable land include wetlands, steep slopes associated with volcanic terrain such as Mount Scott and Scouters Mountain, and the need to extend sewer and water infrastructure to annexed areas.[^4] All residential developments on sites larger than two acres with a minimum of 10% environmentally constrained areas are required to be developed as Planned Unit Developments.[^16]

In 2017, Housing Land Advocates successfully argued before the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) that Happy Valley failed to provide adequate findings to justify a downzone of a property from multi-family residential to single family residential.[^17]

## Recent Housing Developments

- **Good Shepherd Village**: A 143-residence apartment community that is the first affordable housing to be built in Happy Valley and the largest affordable housing development in Clackamas County.[^18] Good Shepherd Village was built on 11 acres of land donated by the Brockamp family.[^18] Apartments are designated for two income levels: some reserved for people earning less than 30% of the area median income ($33,840 for a household of four) and the rest for people earning less than 60% of the area median income ($67,680 for a household of four).[^18] Fifteen of these apartments are reserved for veterans who have experienced homelessness.[^18]

- **Pleasant Valley Villages**: Located in Happy Valley, Ichijo is crafting 171 cutting-edge homes surrounded by convenience.[^19] Multiple builders including Holt Homes and D.R. Horton are active in the community, offering single-family homes and townhomes.[^20]

- **Avery Terrace**: A D.R. Horton new home community nestled in Happy Valley, Oregon, offering both townhomes and single-family homes. Choose from 5 townhome floor plans or 9 versatile single-family home designs ranging from 1,619 to 2,704 square feet.[^21]

- **37-Lot Townhome Project**: A 37-lot attached townhome project in the heart of Happy Valley received land use approval on January 27, 2026.[^22]

## Key Housing Challenges

- **Affordability gap**: Using the 28% rule, you would need to make at least $145K a year to afford the median home price in Happy Valley.[^23] While the city's median household income is $120,702, this still falls short of what is needed to comfortably afford the median home.[^5]

- **Limited rental options**: With only 18% of housing units being renter-occupied, Happy Valley has historically lacked diverse rental housing options.[^9] Good Shepherd Village is the first affordable housing in Happy Valley.[^24]

- **Rapid growth management**: The City of Happy Valley is the fastest growing city in Oregon, yet still places a high value on quality of life, community spirit, and planned growth.[^13] Managing infrastructure to keep pace with growth, particularly in newly annexed areas, is an ongoing challenge.

- **Planning staff capacity**: Happy Valley's four-person planning department works to its full capacity to rewrite requirements on an ongoing basis to respond to every legislative session and rulemaking effort without slowing down permitting of actual developments.[^3]

- **State regulatory burden**: The city has expressed concerns about new state housing production rules. The City of Happy Valley fully shares the State's commitment to increasing housing supply and affordability through data-informed, locally-grounded strategies. After thorough review, the City has significant concerns about the current draft rules. As written, the proposed framework introduces substantial uncertainty, administrative burden, and legal risk for local jurisdictions.[^3]

- **High density requirements**: Under new state model zoning rules, in Klamath Falls, Happy Valley, and Pendleton, the highest-density residential zone allows just 8 homes on a 10,000-square-foot lot, which the state considers insufficient.[^25]

## Local Housing Policies

**Housing Production Strategy**: The HPS, mandated by Oregon law, provides a comprehensive roadmap for encouraging housing production over the next six years.[^26] The strategy was developed with grant funding from the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD).[^26]

**Pleasant Valley/North Carver Comprehensive Plan**: An integrated land use and transportation plan for the city's primary growth area. There are many potential benefits: safer roads over time; ability to reduce congestion; a riverfront in Carver that people can use and enjoy; housing for future residents.[^13]

**Planned Unit Development Requirements**: Happy Valley requires PUD review for larger residential developments, ensuring coordinated planning of open space, infrastructure, and housing variety. All planned unit developments shall have a minimum of 20% of the development's gross land area dedicated to public or commonly held open space and/or recreational area.[^16]

**Metro Affordable Housing Bond**: Happy Valley benefits from the Metro affordable housing bond approved by voters in 2018, which funded the Good Shepherd Village project. The opening also marks a milestone for Metro's affordable housing bond: over one thousand new homes have now been built across greater Portland using bond money, for a total of more than 4,500 in production.[^18]

**Middle Housing Code Amendments**: In compliance with [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001), the city adopted code amendments allowing duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhomes, and cottage clusters in all residential zones, while applying the maximum additional siting and design standards permitted under the law.[^10]
