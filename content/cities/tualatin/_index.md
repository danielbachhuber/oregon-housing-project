Tualatin is a city of 27,383 residents spanning Washington and Clackamas Counties in the [Portland](/cities/portland) metropolitan area.[^1] With a median household income of $105,073, Tualatin is relatively affluent, but faces significant housing affordability challenges common to the region.[^2] The city covers 8.2 square miles and has seen slight population decline from its 2020 peak of 27,883.[^1]

## Housing Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median home price | $630,000 (2025)[^3] |
| Median rent | $1,875[^4] |
| Total housing units | 11,357[^1] |
| Homeownership rate | 55.3%[^1] |
| Vacancy rate | 5.2%[^1] |
| 10-year appreciation | 92.99%[^5] |

Tualatin's housing stock is 49.8% single-family detached homes, with large apartment complexes comprising 29.4% and smaller multifamily buildings at 10.8%.[^5] The median construction year is 1991, reflecting significant growth in the late 20th century.[^1]

## Zoning and Land Use

Tualatin updated its development code to comply with [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001), which requires cities in the Metro region to allow duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, cottage clusters, and townhouses in residential zones.[^6] The city had to reduce parking requirements that exceeded state limits.[^6]

Mayor Frank Bubenik noted that HB 2001 "handcuffed" the council on density decisions, limiting their ability to block developments they might otherwise have rejected.[^7] The first major test came with the Tualatin Heights Apartments rezoning, which was approved after extensive debate to allow 100+ additional units, increasing density by nearly 50%.[^7]

With very little vacant land remaining in the city, Tualatin's focus has shifted to infill development in existing neighborhoods.[^6]

## Buildable Land

According to Tualatin's 2019 Housing Needs Analysis:[^8]

| Land Category | Acres |
|---------------|-------|
| Total residential Plan Designation | 2,556 |
| Developed (no capacity) | 2,193 (86%) |
| Vacant/Partially Vacant | 364 (14%) |
| Buildable within city limits | 96 |
| Basalt Creek (annexed) | 194 |

The city's 322 acres of total buildable land can accommodate approximately 1,207 new dwelling units at the target density of 8 units per net buildable acre.[^8] However, there is a deficit of capacity for medium-high density (109 units) and high-density high-rise (101 units) development through 2040.[^8]

The Basalt Creek area, with 194 buildable acres annexed north of Basalt Creek Parkway, represents what planning officials describe as "the last buildable land zoned this way in Tualatin."[^9]

## Recent Housing Developments

- **Plambeck Gardens**: A 116-unit affordable housing project on a 4.66-acre parcel in Basalt Creek, developed by Community Partners for Affordable Housing. Units will include two, three, and four-bedroom apartments.[^10]

- **Tualatin Heights Apartments**: Rezoning approved in 2024 to add 100+ units, increasing density by nearly 50%.[^7]

- **Downtown Revitalization**: An active city project with Community Advisory Committee meetings ongoing.[^11]

- **Tualatin 2040**: Comprehensive planning initiative completed in 2023 that produced a Housing Needs Analysis, Housing Production Strategy, and Equitable Housing Funding Plan.[^11]

## Key Housing Challenges

Tualatin sits in Washington County, which is the least affordable county for renters in Oregon.[^12] Key challenges include:

- **Severe cost burden**: Over 30% of Tualatin residents spend more than 50% of their income on rent[^12]
- **Rising renter burden**: Renter cost-burdened rates increased from 30% to 56% in recent years[^8]
- **Regional waitlist**: 18,000 applicants waiting for affordable housing county-wide[^12]
- **Workforce housing gap**: 93% of Tualatin workers commute from elsewhere, many unable to afford local housing[^8]
- **Limited land**: Only 96 buildable acres remain within existing city limits[^8]
- **Funding cuts**: Expected reductions to eviction prevention funding threaten housing stability[^13]

A City Council work session in April 2025 addressed rising housing instability and child homelessness in the community.[^13]

## Local Housing Policies

**Limited Affordable Housing Tax Exemption Program**: Property tax exemption for nonprofit organizations providing low-income housing under Tualatin Municipal Code Chapter 14-01.[^14]

**Equitable Housing Funding Plan** (adopted June 2023): Studies potential funding sources for affordable housing production, advancing nine strategic actions from the Housing Production Strategy.[^11] Key mechanisms include:

- System Development Charges (SDC) exemption for affordable housing
- Multiple Unit Property Tax Exemption
- Construction Excise Tax (CET) under exploration as flexible revenue

**Metro Housing Bond**: Tualatin benefits from the $652.8 million affordable housing bond approved by Metro-area voters in 2018, which aims to create permanently affordable homes for 14,000 people across the tri-county region.[^12]
