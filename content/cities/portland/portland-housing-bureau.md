# Portland Housing Bureau

The Portland Housing Bureau is the City of Portland's primary agency responsible for funding affordable housing, ensuring protections for renters, and preserving existing homes. The bureau manages multiple funding sources and programs aimed at addressing Portland's housing crisis.

## Overview

The Portland Housing Bureau operates under the City of Portland's government structure and is responsible for implementing housing policies and managing housing-related funds. Under Portland's new form of government that took effect in January 2025, the bureau reports through the City Administrator [Raymond C. Lee III](/people/raymond-lee).

## Funding Sources

The bureau administers multiple revenue streams for housing programs, including:[^1]
- Short-term rental fees
- Transient Lodging Tax revenues
- Housing Investment Fund
- State and federal housing grants
- Other dedicated housing revenues

## Unbudgeted Balances Discovery (2025-2026)

In November 2025, bureau officials identified approximately $21 million in unspent funds that had not been disclosed to city councilors in time for the mid-fiscal-year budget adjustment process.[^1] Over the following months, as City Administrator Raymond C. Lee III conducted a comprehensive review of bureau finances, the total grew substantially:

- **November 2025**: Initial discovery of $21 million in unspent funds[^1]
- **Early February 2026**: Additional funds identified, bringing total to approximately $40 million[^1]
- **February 6, 2026**: Final disclosure revealed $106 million in "previously unbudgeted housing funds"[^2]

City Councilor [Loretta Smith](/people/loretta-smith) expressed concerns about financial oversight, stating: "This unexpected discovery raises serious concerns about our financial oversight. I am deeply troubled by the possibility that departments may be withholding vital financial information from the council."[^1]

City Administrator Lee attributed the accumulation to Portland's transition from a system where "bureaus and offices developing budgets independently" to one where the city manages "its finances holistically under our new form of government."[^2] He issued a [detailed memo](/cities/portland/files/2026-02-06-unbudgeted-housing-balances-memo.pdf) on February 6, 2026, explaining where the funds were found and how they may be legally spent.[^2]

Council President Jamie Dunphy characterized the situation as "a relic of the old government system of accounting" rather than malicious wrongdoing, though he acknowledged the timing was difficult.[^1]

## Responsibilities

The bureau's self-described responsibilities include:
- Funding affordable housing development
- Ensuring protections for renters
- Preserving existing homes
- Managing city housing programs and initiatives

## Budget

The [Portland Housing Bureau](https://www.portland.gov/phb) manages a substantial budget for housing programs and initiatives.[^3] The bureau regulates a portfolio of over 19,000 units of affordable housing throughout the city and implements programs in four key areas: production and preservation, homeownership, preventing displacement, and ending homelessness.[^3]

As revealed in February 2026, the bureau had accumulated $106 million in previously unbudgeted housing funds across multiple revenue streams.[^2] The discovery highlighted questions about budget transparency and financial management during Portland's government transition.

The bureau's budget comes from diverse sources including short-term rental fees, transient lodging tax revenues, the Housing Investment Fund, and state and federal housing grants.[^1] These funds are intended to support affordable housing development, renter protections, and housing preservation throughout Portland.

The accumulation of unspent funds occurred during a period when Portland faced deep budget cuts and an ongoing housing crisis, raising concerns from city councilors about why these resources were not deployed more quickly to address urgent housing needs.[^1][^2]

## Context

The unspent funds came to light during a period when Portland faced, and continues to face, deep budget cuts and an ongoing housing crisis. The delay in disclosing the funds meant they were not available for consideration during critical budget deliberation periods.[^1][^2]
