# Portland

Portland is Oregon's largest city and the seat of Multnomah County, with a population of approximately 635,749 residents (2024 estimate).[^3] As the state's economic and cultural center, Portland faces significant housing challenges including affordability, homelessness, and limited housing production.

## Overview

Portland is the largest city in Oregon and serves as the anchor of the Portland metropolitan area, which spans Multnomah, Clackamas, and Washington counties. The city transitioned to a new form of government in January 2025, implementing a district-based city council system with a mayor and city administrator structure.[^4]

## Housing Statistics

Portland's housing market faces significant affordability challenges:
- Population: ~635,000 (city proper)
- Major housing affordability issues across all income levels
- Substantial homeless population requiring ongoing intervention

Detailed housing statistics are being compiled.

## Zoning and Land Use

Portland has been at the forefront of implementing state housing reforms, including [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001), which requires cities to allow middle housing types in residential zones.

## Recent Housing Developments

**Portland Housing Bureau Unspent Funds (2025-2026)**: In November 2025, the Portland Housing Bureau identified $21 million in unspent funds. By February 2026, City Administrator [Raymond C. Lee III](/people/raymond-lee) disclosed that the total had grown to $106 million in previously unbudgeted housing funds.[^1] The discovery prompted calls for improved financial oversight from City Councilor [Loretta Smith](/people/loretta-smith) and other council members.[^1][^2]

## Key Housing Challenges

Portland faces several interconnected housing challenges:

- **Affordability crisis**: Housing costs that exceed what many residents can afford
- **Homelessness**: Ongoing crisis requiring emergency interventions and expanded shelter capacity
- **Limited housing production**: Insufficient new housing construction to meet demand
- **Financial oversight**: Questions about how housing funds are managed and deployed, highlighted by the discovery of $106 million in unspent funds[^1]
- **Government transition**: Adapting to new city government structure while managing housing programs

## Local Housing Policies

Portland administers housing programs through the [Portland Housing Bureau](portland-housing-bureau), which manages affordable housing development, renter protections, and housing preservation initiatives.
