## Buildable Land

Information about Canby's buildable land inventory and residential capacity is detailed in the city's Housing Production Strategy[^1] and Housing Needs Analysis.[^3] These documents address land supply constraints and future development capacity needed to meet projected housing needs.

## Recent Housing Developments

**Housing Production Strategy**: On February 4, 2026, Canby's Housing Production Strategy was approved by the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD).[^1]

## Key Housing Challenges

As documented in Canby's Housing Needs Assessment,[^3] the city faces several housing challenges common to the Portland metropolitan area:

- **Housing affordability**: Despite a relatively high median household income of $100,268, housing costs remain a significant burden for many residents, particularly those in lower income brackets
- **Limited buildable land**: Constraints on available residential land within the urban growth boundary limit development capacity and housing supply
- **Workforce housing gap**: The gap between local wages and housing costs makes it difficult for workers to live in the community where they work
- **Infill development pressures**: With limited vacant land, the city must focus on intensifying existing neighborhoods through middle housing and infill development
- **Diverse housing needs**: The need to provide housing options across the income spectrum, from affordable housing to market-rate units, while maintaining community character

The Housing Production Strategy[^1] outlines approaches to address these challenges and meet projected housing needs through 2040.

## Local Housing Policies

The city has developed and received approval for a Housing Production Strategy to address housing needs and comply with state requirements.[^1]
