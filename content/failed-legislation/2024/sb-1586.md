# SB 1586: Fair Housing Law Amendments for Owner-Occupied Units

## Overview

Senate Bill 1586 would have amended Oregon's Fair Housing law to include owner-occupied units, expanding the scope of fair housing protections beyond rental properties and larger buildings.

## Why It Failed

The bill died in committee by mid-February 2024 during Oregon's short legislative session.

**Final Status**: Died in committee (February 2024)

## Key Details

The bill represented an attempt to extend fair housing protections to a broader range of housing situations, including small owner-occupied properties that are sometimes exempt from certain housing discrimination laws. This would have significantly expanded the reach of Oregon's fair housing regulations.

The bill's failure suggests resistance to expanding regulatory requirements on small property owners, particularly those living in their own properties.

## Supporters

- Fair housing advocacy organizations
- Civil rights groups

## Opponents

- Small property owners
- Landlord associations concerned about increased regulation

## Related Legislation

- Oregon's existing Fair Housing Act provisions
- Federal Fair Housing Act exemptions for owner-occupied buildings
