# HB 4063: Medical Hardship Rent Payment Coverage

## Overview

House Bill 4063 (in its original form) would have forced housing providers to cover costs associated with missed rent payments when tenants experienced medical problems or hardships.

## Why It Failed

The bill died in committee by mid-February 2024. The proposal faced significant opposition from landlords and property managers who argued it would shift medical hardship costs inappropriately to housing providers.

**Final Status**: Died in committee (February 2024)

## Key Details

The bill represented an attempt to protect tenants facing medical emergencies or extended illnesses from eviction due to missed rent payments. However, requiring landlords to absorb these costs was seen as financially unsustainable, particularly for small property owners.

The bill highlighted the tension between tenant protections and property owner financial viability, especially in cases where neither party is responsible for the hardship but someone must bear the cost.

**Note**: A different version of HB 4063 with revised provisions may have been introduced later in the session or in subsequent sessions.
