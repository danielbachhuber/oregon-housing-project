# HB 4126: Repeal Prohibition on Local Rent Control

## Overview

House Bill 4126 would have repealed Oregon's prohibition on local rent control, allowing cities and counties to adopt their own rent control ordinances beyond the statewide rent stabilization law enacted in 2019 under [SB 608](/legislation/2019/sb-608).

## Why It Failed

The bill died in committee by mid-February 2024, likely facing opposition from landlords and housing providers who argued that additional local rent control would further discourage housing construction and investment.

**Final Status**: Died in committee (February 2024)

## Key Details

Oregon enacted statewide rent control in 2019 through SB 608, capping annual rent increases at 7% plus inflation. However, state law has historically prohibited local governments from enacting their own rent control ordinances that go beyond state requirements.

This bill would have given cities like Portland the authority to implement stricter local rent control measures if they chose to do so. The failure suggests continued political resistance to expanded rent control, despite Oregon already having statewide rent stabilization.
