# Measure 118: Corporate Tax Revenue Rebate for Residents

## Overview

Ballot Measure 118 would have increased Oregon's corporate minimum tax to 3% on businesses with sales exceeding $25 million and used the revenue to provide an annual $1,600 rebate to all Oregon residents, regardless of income level. While not strictly a housing measure, it had significant implications for housing affordability through the universal basic income-style payments.

## Why It Failed

Oregon voters overwhelmingly rejected Measure 118 in the November 2024 election.

**Final Status**: Rejected 79% No - 21% Yes

The measure united an unusual coalition of opponents across the political spectrum, including Democratic Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek), approximately 50 lawmakers from both parties, labor unions, and more than 200 companies and business groups.

## Key Details

### What It Would Have Done

- Increased the state corporate minimum tax from current levels to 3% for businesses with over $25 million in sales
- Distributed tax revenue as annual $1,600 rebates to all Oregonians
- Created a universal benefit regardless of income or need

### Opposition Campaign

Opponents led by the Oregon Business & Industry lobby group raised $19.4 million and conducted an extensive campaign against the measure. Key arguments included:

- The tax would function as a **sales tax** passed on to consumers
- Would increase costs for consumers on everyday goods
- Could harm Oregon's business climate and economic competitiveness
- Universal rebate approach inefficient compared to targeted assistance

### Progressive Groups' Withdrawal

Several progressive groups initially endorsed the measure but later withdrew their support in October 2024, citing concerns about implementation and potential negative consequences.

## Supporters

- Economic security advocates
- Universal basic income proponents
- Some anti-poverty organizations (though some withdrew support)

## Opponents

- [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) - Governor
- Oregon Business & Industry (led opposition campaign)
- Approximately 50 bipartisan state lawmakers
- Labor unions
- More than 200 companies and business groups
- Many progressive organizations (after initial support)

## Housing Affordability Connection

While not a housing-specific measure, the $1,600 annual rebate would have provided direct financial assistance that could help with housing costs. However, the measure's overwhelming defeat suggests Oregon voters preferred targeted housing assistance over universal payments funded by corporate taxes.
