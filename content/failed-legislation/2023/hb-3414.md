# HB 3414: Housing Accountability and Production Office

## Overview

House Bill 3414 was Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s priority legislation to adjust land use rules both within and beyond Oregon's urban growth boundaries to facilitate housing construction. The bill would have established the Housing Accountability and Production Office to partner with local governments to accelerate the development of new housing in communities across the state.

## Why It Failed

The bill passed the House but died in the Senate on the very last day of the 2023 legislative session. In a stunning defeat for the first-term Democratic governor, enough Democratic senators voted against the measure to kill it.

**Final Status**: Failed in Senate 15-10 (needed 16 votes to pass in the 30-member Senate)

Despite bipartisan support, only seven of seventeen Democrats present voted for the bill, along with all eight Republicans present. The bill fell one vote short of the 16 needed to pass.

## Key Details

The most controversial provision would have allowed cities to quickly expand their urban growth boundaries by up to 150 acres. This land use reform was designed to increase the availability of buildable land through careful, measured changes to Oregon's strict land use planning system.

The failure represented a significant setback for Governor Kotek's housing agenda and highlighted divisions within the Democratic caucus over land use policy and urban growth boundaries.
