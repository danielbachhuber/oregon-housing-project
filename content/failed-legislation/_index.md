# Failed Housing-Related Legislation in Oregon

This section documents housing-related initiatives, bills, and ballot measures in Oregon that did not become law. Understanding what didn't pass is just as important as what did—failed legislation reveals political obstacles, controversial policies, and the limits of what's politically feasible in Oregon's housing policy landscape.

## Why Document Failed Legislation?

- **Learning from defeats**: Failed bills often re-emerge in modified form in future sessions
- **Understanding opposition**: Reveals which interests and arguments successfully blocked reforms
- **Historical context**: Shows the evolution of housing policy debates over time
- **Missed opportunities**: Highlights solutions that could have addressed housing challenges

## Scope

This section includes:
- Bills that died in committee
- Bills defeated on the floor
- Ballot measures rejected by voters
- Withdrawn or substantially gutted legislation
- Initiatives that failed to gather enough signatures
