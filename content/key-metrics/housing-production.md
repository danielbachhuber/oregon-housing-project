# Housing Production

Oregon's housing production has declined significantly in recent years, falling far short of the state's goals and needs.

## State Production Goal

In January 2023, Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) issued [Executive Order 23-04](/legislation/2023/eo-23-04), establishing a statewide housing production goal of **36,000 new homes per year**.[^1]

## Recent Production Trends

Oregon's actual housing production has been declining and falling dramatically short of this goal:

- **2022**: Approximately 20,000 residential permits[^2]
- **2023**: Less than 18,000 residential permits[^2]
- **2024**: 14,270 residential permits[^2]

This represents a troubling downward trend, with 2024 production reaching less than 40% of the state's 36,000-home annual target.

## Historical Context

Housing production peaked in 2005 when developers pulled permits for more than 31,000 homes. The market collapsed with the 2008 housing crash—production plummeted to about 7,000 homes statewide in 2009. While homebuilding slowly increased heading out of the recession, production hasn't returned to 1990s levels and fell again during the COVID pandemic.[^2]

## Long-Term Housing Needs

According to the 2024 Oregon Housing Needs Analysis, the state needs to build approximately **29,500 new homes every year from 2024-2044** to meet demand. About two-thirds of these homes need to be affordable to families earning less than 60% of the median income in their area.[^3]

At current production levels (14,270 permits in 2024), Oregon is building only about half of what's needed to meet this long-term goal, exacerbating the state's ongoing housing shortage.
