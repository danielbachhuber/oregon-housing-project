# Homeownership Assistance Program

The Legislature in 1995 created a Home Ownership Assistance Account (O.L. 1995, ch.174) to help lower-income families buy homes, reflecting a 90s policy focus on first-time homebuyer support. Programs for farmworker housing loans (1993) and a risk-sharing finance program with HUD (1995) were also launched.
