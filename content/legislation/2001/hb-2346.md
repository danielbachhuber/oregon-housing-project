## Overview

House Bill 2346, passed in 2001 and effective January 1, 2002, was Oregon's legislative response to the construction defect litigation crisis that affected the state's residential construction industry in the late 1990s. The bill addressed widespread concerns about construction defects in condominiums and other common interest communities, particularly issues related to water intrusion, structural defects, and other latent construction problems.

The legislation established a comprehensive legal framework for handling construction defect claims, including:

- A 10-year statute of repose limiting the time period during which homeowners could bring construction defect claims against developers and contractors
- Pre-litigation notice requirements designed to encourage early resolution
- Mandatory opportunity for developers to inspect and repair defects before litigation
- Clear definitions of covered defects and applicable standards

This bill was significant in Oregon's housing policy history as it sought to provide legal certainty to developers while maintaining protections for homeowners. The construction defect litigation crisis of the late 1990s had chilled condominium development in Oregon, with developers concerned about open-ended liability exposure.

## Key Provisions

### 10-Year Statute of Repose
The bill established a 10-year limitation period from the date of substantial completion for bringing construction defect claims. This provided developers with certainty about their liability exposure timeline.

### Pre-Litigation Notice and Repair Opportunity
HB 2346 required homeowners to provide written notice of alleged defects to developers and contractors before filing a lawsuit. Developers were given an opportunity to inspect the property and offer to repair the defects, encouraging resolution without costly litigation.

### Scope of Covered Defects
The legislation addressed various types of construction defects, including:
- Water intrusion and moisture-related damage
- Structural defects affecting safety or habitability
- Code violations existing at the time of construction
- Defects in major building systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)

### Application to Common Interest Communities
The bill specifically applied to condominiums and other common interest communities, recognizing the unique challenges of multi-unit residential construction and the complexities of defect claims in these settings.

## Impact

HB 2346's impact on Oregon's housing market was significant:

**Developer Certainty**: The 10-year statute of repose provided developers with a defined endpoint for potential liability, making condominium development more financially predictable and potentially more attractive to investors.

**Condominium Development**: By addressing the liability concerns that had chilled the condominium market, the bill was intended to encourage renewed development of multi-family housing, particularly condominiums, which are an important source of affordable homeownership opportunities.

**Litigation Framework**: The pre-litigation notice and repair requirements created a structured process that encouraged resolution of defects through repair rather than costly litigation, benefiting both developers and homeowners.

**Homeowner Protections**: While limiting the time period for claims, the bill still provided homeowners with a substantial 10-year window to discover and address construction defects, recognizing that many serious defects are latent and may not become apparent immediately.

## Context and Historical Significance

The late 1990s construction defect litigation crisis significantly affected Oregon's housing development patterns. Multiple high-profile cases involving serious construction defects in condominium projects led to expensive litigation and insurance challenges. Some developers stopped building condominiums entirely, focusing instead on apartment buildings (which were rental properties with different liability considerations) or single-family homes.

This shift away from condominium development reduced homeownership opportunities, particularly for first-time buyers and moderate-income households who often relied on condominiums as an affordable entry point into homeownership.

HB 2346 represented a legislative attempt to recalibrate the balance between developer liability and homeowner protection, with the goal of encouraging resumed condominium development while maintaining meaningful protections for buyers.

## Related Legislation

Oregon has continued to address construction defect liability and condominium development issues in subsequent legislative sessions, with various bills proposing modifications to the framework established by HB2346.
