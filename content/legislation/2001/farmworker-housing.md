# Farmworker Housing Development Account

In 2001, Oregon established the Farmworker Housing Development Account (O.L. 2001, ch.310) to fund safe, affordable housing for farm workers. The state also began piloting innovative programs (e.g. "Oregon Housing Plus" in 2001) to leverage federal grants and encourage partnerships for special-needs housing.
