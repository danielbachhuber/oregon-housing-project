# HB 4079 - Affordable Housing Pilot Outside UGBs

The 2016 legislature green-lit a pilot program letting two cities (one under 25,000 population, one over) expand beyond their Urban Growth Boundary by up to 50 acres for affordable housing development. This experimental carve-out acknowledged the land supply crunch – aiming to test if building affordable homes on farm or forest edges could relieve pressure. The pilot results will inform future land-use flexibility for housing.
