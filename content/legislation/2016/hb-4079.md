Affordable Housing Pilot Program allowing two cities to expand urban growth boundaries by up to 50 acres for affordable housing development.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2016R1/Measures/Overview/HB4079)

## Overview

House Bill 4079 established a pilot program to help cities build affordable housing by allowing a limited expansion of urban growth boundaries (UGBs) without going through the standard lengthy UGB amendment process. The program was administered by the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) with rules adopted by July 1, 2017.

## Key Provisions

- **Two Pilot Projects**: The commission was directed to select two pilot projects—one from a city with a population of 30,000 or less, and one from a city with a population greater than 30,000.
- **UGB Expansion**: Selected cities could expand their UGB by up to 50 acres using an expedited process.
- **Affordability Requirement**: At least 30% of newly built housing on the expanded land must be affordable.
- **50-Year Protection**: Land added through the pilot program must be protected for affordable housing use for at least 50 years.
- **Eligible Cities Over 25,000**: Albany, Bend, Corvallis, Eugene, Grants Pass, McMinnville, Medford, Redmond, and Springfield.
- **Eligible Cities Under 25,000**: Incorporated cities except those in Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Polk, and Washington counties.

## Program Intent

The pilot program was designed to:
1. Encourage local governments to provide an adequate supply of land within urban growth boundaries dedicated to affordable housing
2. Encourage development of affordable housing on dedicated land
3. Protect land dedicated to affordable housing from conversion to other uses

DLCD was required to report to the Legislature on implementation during each regular session.
