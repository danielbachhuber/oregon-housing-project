# HB 4143

Tenant protection bill requiring 90 days' notice for rent increases and prohibiting rent increases during the first year of tenancy.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2016R1/Measures/Overview/HB4143)

## Overview

House Bill 4143 was one of Oregon's early tenant protection measures, passed during a period of rapidly rising rents, particularly in the Portland metropolitan area. The bill provided basic notice requirements for rent increases to give tenants more time to plan for housing cost changes.

## Key Provisions

- **90-Day Notice Requirement**: Landlords must provide tenants with 90 days' written notice before implementing a rent increase.
- **First-Year Protection**: Landlords are prohibited from increasing rent during the first year of a tenancy.

## Context

HB 4143 was passed during Oregon's emerging housing affordability crisis. In 2015, Portland declared a housing emergency as the number of unsheltered homeless people rose significantly and rents in central Portland neighborhoods increased by 14% in a single year. This bill was part of a package of housing reforms in the 2016 session, along with [SB 1533](/legislation/2016/sb-1533) (inclusionary zoning) and [HB 4079](/legislation/2016/hb-4079) (affordable housing pilot).

The protections in HB 4143 were later expanded significantly by [SB 608](/legislation/2019/sb-608) in 2019, which established statewide rent stabilization and just-cause eviction requirements.
