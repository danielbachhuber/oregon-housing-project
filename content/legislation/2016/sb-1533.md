# SB 1533 - Inclusionary Zoning Restored

Reversing the 17-year ban, Oregon passed SB 1533 in 2016 to lift the prohibition on inclusionary zoning. Cities can now require that up to 20% of units in new developments (of 20+ units) be affordable, within limits. In tandem, SB 1533 allowed local governments to enact a construction excise tax (up to 1% on new residential, with revenue for affordable housing). This landmark bill gave cities like Portland a tool to mandate mixed-income housing in hot markets, and created new funding streams for housing projects statewide.
