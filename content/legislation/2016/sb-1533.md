# SB 1533

Repealed Oregon's 17-year ban on inclusionary zoning, allowing local governments to require developers to include affordable units in new multifamily projects of 20+ units. Also enabled a construction excise tax for affordable housing.

## Overview

Senate Bill 1533 was a significant shift in Oregon housing policy, lifting the statewide ban on inclusionary zoning that had been in place since 1999 (when HB 2658 was passed). Oregon had been one of only three states—alongside Arizona and Texas—to prohibit local governments from mandating affordable housing requirements in new developments.

## Key Provisions

- **Inclusionary Zoning**: Allows local governments to require up to 20% of units in new multifamily structures of 20 or more units to be designated as affordable housing (for households earning 80% or less of Area Median Income).
- **Developer Incentives Required**: Local governments must offer incentives to offset the cost of providing affordable units, such as density bonuses, tax abatements, or fee waivers.
- **Fee-in-Lieu Option**: Developers may pay a fee instead of building the required affordable units.
- **Construction Excise Tax**: Grants cities and counties authority to impose a construction excise tax of up to 1% on new development, with residential CET revenues dedicated 100% to affordable housing.

## Impact

Following passage of SB 1533, Portland became the first Oregon city to adopt a comprehensive inclusionary zoning policy, going beyond the state's baseline requirements. However, some smaller cities found the bill's conditions made inclusionary zoning difficult to implement effectively.
