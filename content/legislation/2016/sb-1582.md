[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2016R1/Measures/Overview/SB1582)

## Overview

Senate Bill 1582 created the framework for Oregon's Local Innovation and Fast Track (LIFT) Housing Program, a major state investment in affordable rental housing development. The LIFT program provides funding to help build and preserve affordable rental housing for low-income Oregonians.

## Key Provisions

- **Program Parameters**: Established the structure and guidelines for the LIFT program.
- **Administrative Funding**: Provided funding for program administration through Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS).
- **Affordable Housing Investment**: Created a vehicle for state investment in affordable housing production.

## Impact

The LIFT program has become one of Oregon's primary tools for funding affordable housing development. Since its creation, LIFT has received significant appropriations through general obligation bonds, including $500 million allocated in 2021 (through SB 5505/SB 5506). The program supports both new construction and preservation of existing affordable housing.

LIFT works alongside other state and federal programs—including the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit—to close funding gaps and make affordable housing projects financially viable.

## Sponsors

Introduced at the request of Governor Kate Brown.
