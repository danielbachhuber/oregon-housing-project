# SB 799 - Eviction Reforms

Learning from pandemic measures, SB 799 (2023) permanently revised Oregon's eviction timeline and court process to prevent quick evictions for nonpayment. It extended the pay-or-quit notice period for nonpayment of rent from 72 hours to 10 days statewide.

It also mandates a 60-day pause on eviction proceedings if a tenant provides proof of a pending rental assistance application, buying more time for aid to arrive. Additionally, SB 799 requires courts to seal eviction records if an eviction is dismissed or if the tenant wins, so that tenants aren't blacklisted for mere filings.

It even bars evictions based on minor occupancy violations (like a tenant having an extra roommate in violation of a lease, if that local occupancy limit is more strict than state law allows). These changes, effective July 2023, target housing instability by slowing down the eviction machine and giving renters a fair chance to catch up – an important homelessness prevention strategy.
