# SB 611 - Stronger Rent Control Cap

To further strengthen 2019's rent cap amid high inflation, lawmakers passed SB 611 (2023) to lower Oregon's rent-increase limit. Now annual rent hikes are capped at the lesser of 10% or 7% + CPI (down from a previous flat 7% + CPI which had resulted in allowable increases above 14%).

SB 611 also increased relocation assistance to three months' rent (up from one) when landlords evict tenants for no-cause under exemptions or raise rent over the cap in error. Effective July 2023, this ensures renters face a slightly lower maximum increase and provides more relief if they are displaced by a landlord's permitted exception.

It fine-tuned the nation's first statewide rent control in light of economic conditions, keeping Oregon at the forefront of renter protection policy.
