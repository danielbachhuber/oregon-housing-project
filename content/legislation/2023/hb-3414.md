[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB3414)

## Overview

House Bill 3414 was introduced at the request of Governor Tina Kotek to support her goal of producing 36,000 new homes per year in Oregon. The bill proposed significant changes to Oregon's land use system to accelerate housing production. Despite passing the House with bipartisan support, it failed in the Senate on the final day of the 2023 session by a single vote—killed by Democrats who opposed the land use changes.

## Key Provisions

- **Expedited UGB Expansion**: Would have allowed cities to quickly expand their urban growth boundaries by up to 150 acres through an expedited process.
- **Housing Accountability and Production Office**: Would have created a new state office to ensure cities work with developers to get housing built.
- **Building Code Adjustments**: Would have permitted certain adjustments in local building codes to allow for new development.
- **Land Use Reforms**: Proposed changes to land use rules both within and beyond Oregon's urban growth boundaries.

## Why It Failed

HB 3414 failed in the Senate by just one vote, with only seven of seventeen Democrats present voting for the bill. All eight Republicans present voted in favor. The bill's urban growth boundary provisions proved particularly controversial.

**Key Opposition:**
- **League of Oregon Cities**: Led opposition with many member cities objecting to state interference with local zoning codes.
- **Oregon League of Conservation Voters**: Opposed UGB expansion provisions as contributing to sprawl and climate change.
- **Preservationists**: Concerned about impacts on Oregon's land use planning system established by [SB 100 (1973)](/legislation/1973/sb-100).

## Legacy

After HB 3414's failure, Governor Kotek returned in 2024 with a revised approach. [SB 1537 (2024)](/legislation/2024/sb-1537) ultimately passed, creating the Housing Accountability and Production Office (HAPO) without the controversial UGB expansion provisions. The 2024 housing package took a more targeted approach that secured broader support while advancing many of Kotek's housing production goals.
