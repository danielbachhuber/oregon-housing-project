# HB 2889 - Oregon Housing Needs Analysis (OHNA)

HB 2889 (2023) establishes the Oregon Housing Needs Analysis (OHNA) system. Under OHNA, the state will determine the housing need (overall units and units by affordability level) for each city for the next 20 years, replacing the old local-centric system.

Cities over 10,000 population must then adopt Housing Production Strategies to meet those needs – with specific metrics and actions – and update them regularly. Together with HB 2001 (2023), which created the Housing Accountability and Production Office, these laws represent a major policy shift: the state is moving from just planning for housing to actively ensuring housing gets built.

Oregon will allocate numeric housing production targets to each city and monitor outcomes. These laws (often described as Oregon's answer to California's RHNA process) aim to break the logjam of local inertia – pushing cities to zone, permit, and incentivize enough development to accommodate growth.
