[Original Document](/legislation/2023/files/eo-23-04.pdf)

## Overview

Signed by Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) on her first full day in office, Executive Order 23-04 set an ambitious housing production goal and established a council of experts to develop an action plan for meeting Oregon's housing needs. This was one of three executive orders signed on January 10, 2023, focused on addressing homelessness and housing issues in Oregon.[^1]

## Key Provisions

- **Annual Production Goal**: Sets a target of 36,000 additional housing units per year at all levels of affordability across the state, representing an 80 percent increase over current construction trends at the time. Oregon pulled just over 20,000 residential permits in 2022, the year before the executive order was signed.[^3]
- **Ten-Year Vision**: Establishes a goal to build 360,000 additional homes over the next decade to address Oregon's housing shortage and keep pace with projected population growth.
- **Housing Production Advisory Council**: Creates a council of experts charged with proposing an action plan to meet the state's housing production goals.

## Impact

The housing production goal established by EO 23-04 has been subsequently refined based on the Oregon Housing Needs Analysis. The current production goal to meet current and future needs is 29,522 homes per year over the next decade.[^2]

The executive order set the framework for a coordinated state response to Oregon's housing crisis and has driven subsequent legislative and policy initiatives focused on increasing housing production.
