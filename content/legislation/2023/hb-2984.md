# HB 2984 - Adaptive Reuse and Innovations

HB 2984 (2023) allows conversion of vacant commercial buildings to housing without typical zoning hurdles or system development charges. The Legislature also funded modular housing and land banking programs (HB 2002, 2023). These encourage creative solutions to add housing stock quickly by reusing existing structures and reducing costs.
