# HB 4001

Emergency shelter legislation allowing religious institutions to host overnight camping for homeless individuals and easing zoning restrictions for transitional housing.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2020R1/Measures/Overview/HB4001)

## Overview

House Bill 4001 was passed during the 2020 short session as Oregon grappled with a severe homelessness crisis. At the time, more than 64% of people experiencing homelessness in Oregon were unsheltered. The bill aimed to expand options for providing emergency shelter by allowing religious institutions to offer overnight camping space and by easing zoning restrictions for transitional housing within urban growth boundaries.

## Key Provisions

- **Religious Institution Camping**: Allows churches, synagogues, and similar religious institutions to offer overnight camping space on their property to homeless persons.
- **Transitional Housing Accommodations**: Inside urban growth boundaries, local governments may authorize transitional housing used as individual living units for individuals who lack permanent or safe shelter and who cannot be placed in other low-income housing.
- **Emergency Housing Account**: Established provisions for the Oregon Housing Stability Council to develop policy for awarding grants to organizations providing assistance to low and very low income individuals, including those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.

## Appropriations

- $28.5 million for grants and technical assistance
- $1.5 million to Yamhill County for a navigation center within the City of McMinnville's urban growth boundary
- $2.5 million to the City of Bend for a navigation center

## Context

The 2020 session was a 35-day short session in which House Speaker [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) proposed a statewide emergency declaration to ease zoning restrictions for homeless shelters. While the full emergency declaration was not adopted, HB 4001 represented a step toward expanding shelter options. This legislation set the stage for later emergency shelter provisions in [HB 2006 (2021)](/legislation/2021/hb-2006) and subsequent bills.
