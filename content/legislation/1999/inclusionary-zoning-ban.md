# Inclusionary Zoning Ban

Oregon became (with Texas) one of the only states to prohibit mandatory inclusionary housing in 1999. That year's legislature, pressured by homebuilders, passed a preemption barring cities and counties from requiring developers to include affordable units in new developments. This ban on inclusionary zoning (formerly ORS 197.309) stood until 2016. It reflected the 90s political climate favoring market-led development, and removed a tool that other states and cities were using to generate affordable units in private projects.
