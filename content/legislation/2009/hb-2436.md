# HB 2436 - Housing Opportunity Bill

To generate dedicated funding for affordable housing, Oregon imposed a new document recording fee in 2009. The fee (initially $15 on real estate recordings) created an ongoing revenue stream for the state's Housing Fund. In 2013, an extra $5 was added earmarked for veterans' housing, and in 2018 the fee was tripled (to $60 total) to greatly expand funding. These funds flow into accounts for housing development, down-payment assistance, and homelessness prevention, marking a significant state investment in affordable housing.
