# SB 1051 - Fast-Track and ADUs

In response to the housing supply shortage, SB 1051 (2017) streamlined approvals and expanded housing options. It requires cities and counties to approve affordable housing developments of ≥5 units within 100 days (faster than the usual 120-day land use clock) when at least half the units are affordable at 60% MFI or below. It also updated the definition of "needed housing" to include affordable units, reinforcing clear-and-objective approval standards.

Critically, SB 1051 legalized Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in all single-family zones statewide (for cities >2,500) and allowed religious institutions to build affordable housing on their land by right. These reforms removed local barriers to smaller infill housing and faith-based affordable projects, leading to more ADUs and creative development in urban areas.
