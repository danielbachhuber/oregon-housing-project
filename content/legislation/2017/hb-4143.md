# HB 4143 - Tenant Protections

Cities like Portland led with renter protections (e.g. Relocation Assistance for no-cause evictions), and in 2017 the state followed with HB 4143 requiring 90-day notice for rent increases and banning rent hikes in the first year of tenancy. This was an interim step to temper sudden rent spikes while larger reforms were debated.
