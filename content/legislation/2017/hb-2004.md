# HB 2004 (Did Not Pass)

Rent control and just-cause eviction bill that passed the House but failed in the Senate. Predecessor to [SB 608 (2019)](/legislation/2019/sb-608).

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB2004)

## Overview

House Bill 2004 was an ambitious tenant protection bill that would have expanded renters' rights and provided protections against no-cause evictions. The bill passed the Oregon House on April 4, 2017, with a vote of 33-25, but ultimately failed in the Oregon State Senate.

## Key Provisions

- **Just-Cause Eviction Protection**: Would have prohibited landlords from terminating month-to-month tenancies without cause after the first six months of occupancy.
- **90-Day Notice Requirement**: Required 90 days written notice for terminations, plus payment of one month's rent as relocation assistance.
- **Rent Stabilization Authority**: Would have removed the statewide prohibition on local rent stabilization ordinances, allowing cities and counties to implement rent control programs.

## Why It Failed

After passing the House, HB 2004 received a public hearing in the Senate Human Services Committee on May 3, 2017, but did not advance. Opposition came from landlord groups and some legislators who were concerned about the impact on housing supply.

## Legacy

The failure of HB 2004 did not end the push for tenant protections. In 2019, Oregon passed [SB 608](/legislation/2019/sb-608), which made Oregon the first state in the nation to implement statewide rent stabilization, capping annual rent increases at 7% plus inflation for buildings over 15 years old and establishing just-cause eviction standards after 12 months of tenancy.
