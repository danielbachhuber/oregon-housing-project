# HB 2007 (Did Not Pass)

Early "middle housing" bill that would have legalized duplexes statewide. Failed in the Senate but laid groundwork for [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001).

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB2007)

## Overview

House Bill 2007 was introduced by Representative [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) as an early attempt to address Oregon's housing shortage by legalizing duplexes in residential zones across the state. Though the bill failed, it served as a crucial "trial run" that helped housing advocates identify opponents, locate potential dealbreakers, and build the coalition that would eventually pass [HB 2001](/legislation/2019/hb-2001) two years later.

## Key Provisions

- Would have preempted local zoning ordinances to allow duplex construction in areas zoned for single-family housing
- Applied to cities across Oregon

## Why It Failed

HB 2007 was killed in the Oregon Senate, largely due to opposition from Democratic Senator Kathleen Taylor. The bill generated controversy as it pitted housing advocates against neighborhood preservationists over questions of local zoning authority.

## Legacy

According to Sightline Institute's Michael Andersen, the failure of HB 2007 proved helpful. The "trial run" provided important lessons for revising the policy proposal and building a broader coalition. When Kotek tried again in 2019 with [HB 2001](/legislation/2019/hb-2001), she expanded the proposal beyond duplexes to include triplexes, fourplexes, and cottage clusters, and the bill passed with bipartisan support.

## Sponsors
