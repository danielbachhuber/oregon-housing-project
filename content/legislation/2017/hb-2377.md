# HB 2377

Extended and modified the Affordable Housing Tax Credit program to incentivize development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB2377)

## Overview

House Bill 2377 updated Oregon's affordable housing tax credit program, which provides tax incentives for the development and rehabilitation of affordable multifamily rental housing. The bill modified the definition of "eligible rental property" and extended provisions designed to encourage investment in affordable housing.

## Key Provisions

- **Eligible Rental Property**: Defined as newly rehabilitated or constructed multiunit rental housing that meets affordability requirements.
- **Tax Credit Incentives**: Provided tax credit benefits to encourage investment in affordable housing development.

## Context

HB 2377 was part of a broader set of housing initiatives during the 2017 session, which also included failed efforts on middle housing ([HB 2007](/legislation/2017/hb-2007)) and tenant protections ([HB 2004](/legislation/2017/hb-2004)). While those more ambitious reforms did not pass, HB 2377's incremental improvements to tax incentive programs helped maintain support for affordable housing development.

The Oregon Affordable Housing Tax Credit has been one of the state's key tools for supporting affordable housing production, working alongside the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.
