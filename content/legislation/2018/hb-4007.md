# HB 4007 - Housing Affordability Package

In 2018, Oregon substantially increased housing funding and planning requirements. HB 4007 (2018) raised the document recording fee surcharge from $20 to $60, expected to generate ~$60 million extra per biennium for housing programs. This marked a significant expansion of state investment in affordable housing development, down-payment assistance, and homelessness prevention.
