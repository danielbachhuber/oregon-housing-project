# HB 4006 - Rent Burden Strategies

HB 4006 (2018) mandates that cities with "severely rent-burdened" populations (over 25% of renters spending >50% income on rent) hold public meetings and adopt strategies to reduce rent burdens. This shone a spotlight on cost-burdened households and prodded local officials to acknowledge and plan for affordability challenges.
