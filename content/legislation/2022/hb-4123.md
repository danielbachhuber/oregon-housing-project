Created and funded eight pilot sites across Oregon to support city-county collaboration on homelessness services.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2022R1/Measures/Overview/HB4123)

## Overview

House Bill 4123 established a pilot program to test new approaches to addressing homelessness through enhanced coordination between cities and counties. The bill recognized that effective homelessness response requires collaboration across jurisdictional boundaries.

## Key Provisions

- **Pilot Sites**: Created eight pilot sites across Oregon to test coordinated homelessness service delivery.
- **City-County Collaboration**: Required participating cities and counties to work together on homelessness response rather than operating separate, potentially duplicative systems.
- **Funding**: Provided funding to support the pilot program's implementation and evaluation.

## Impact

The pilot program aimed to identify best practices for intergovernmental collaboration on homelessness that could be scaled statewide. By requiring cities and counties to coordinate their efforts, the program sought to reduce fragmentation in the homelessness response system and improve outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness.

The lessons learned from these pilots have informed subsequent homelessness policy, including provisions in [EO 23-04](/legislation/2023/eo-23-04) and later legislative efforts to create more coordinated statewide responses to homelessness.
