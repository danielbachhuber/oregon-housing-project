## Overview

House Bill 4064 made technical changes to Oregon's manufactured home park laws, with a particular focus on supporting residents who were affected by the devastating 2020 wildfire season. Manufactured homes are a significant source of affordable housing in Oregon, and the 2020 fires destroyed numerous manufactured home parks, particularly in southern Oregon.

## Key Provisions

- **Wildfire Recovery Protections**: Provided specific protections for manufactured home park residents impacted by the 2020 wildfires, helping them maintain housing stability during recovery.
- **Park Development**: Made it easier to establish new manufactured home parks by streamlining certain regulatory requirements.
- **Technical Updates**: Made various technical changes to existing manufactured home park statutes.

## Context

Oregon's 2020 wildfire season was one of the most destructive in state history. Multiple manufactured home parks were destroyed, displacing hundreds of households who often had limited resources to find alternative housing. HB 4064 was part of the state's ongoing wildfire recovery efforts and recognition that manufactured housing plays a critical role in Oregon's affordable housing supply.

## Impact

By protecting existing manufactured home park residents and making it easier to develop new parks, HB 4064 helped preserve and expand one of Oregon's most accessible forms of affordable homeownership.
