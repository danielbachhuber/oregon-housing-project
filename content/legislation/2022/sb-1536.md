# SB 1536 - Right to Cooling for Renters

After a deadly heatwave, Oregon enacted SB 1536 in 2022 to ensure tenants can protect themselves from extreme heat. It prohibits landlords from restricting installation of portable cooling devices like window AC units or evaporative coolers in rental units (with only narrow exceptions for safety). Landlords must allow at least one cooling device per unit and cannot enforce blanket bans during summer months. They can require professional installation or removal during winter, but cannot leave tenants without a reasonable means to cool their home.

Oregon thus became one of the first states guaranteeing renters the right to air-condition their homes – a response to climate change and a public health necessity after multiple heat fatalities in low-income housing.
