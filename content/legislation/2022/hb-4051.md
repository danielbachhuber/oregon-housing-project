## Overview

House Bill 4051 was a housing omnibus bill passed during the 2022 short session that addressed several ongoing housing and homelessness policy needs. The bill extended important temporary provisions and made technical corrections to prior legislation.

## Key Provisions

- **Task Force Extension**: Extended the Task Force on Homelessness and Racial Disparities to continue studying the intersection of homelessness and racial inequity.
- **Emergency Shelter Flexibility**: Extended key provisions of HB 2006 (2021) that provided temporary flexibility for local governments to site emergency shelters through July 1, 2023.
- **SB 8 Technical Fix**: Corrected a small technical error in [SB 8 (2021)](/legislation/2021/sb-8) related to affordable housing development on commercial and institutional land.

## Context

The 2022 short session occurred as Oregon continued to grapple with high levels of homelessness and rising housing costs. HB 4051 ensured that emergency measures enacted during the pandemic period remained available to local governments while longer-term solutions were developed.
