# Oregon Lender's Tax Credit Program

The Oregon Lender's Tax Credit Program was established (O.L. 1989, ch.1045) to incentivize private lenders to finance low-income housing by giving state tax credits. This marked an early state intervention to encourage affordable housing development through financial incentives.
