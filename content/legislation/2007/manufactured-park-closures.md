# Manufactured Park Closure Protections

With mobile home park closures mounting, the 2007 legislature strengthened tenant rights in park closures. Park owners are now required to give at least 365 days' notice before closure and pay specified relocation assistance to displaced residents. Lawmakers also approved tax incentives (capital gains tax forgiveness) for park owners who sell to resident co-ops or nonprofits. These measures came as Oregon declared a "manufactured housing crisis" – offering one year to relocate gave residents more time to find new placements or purchase the park.
