# HB 2735 - Rent Increase Notice

Oregon addressed rising rents by requiring 60-day notice for rent increases (for month-to-month tenancies over a year) starting in the late 2000s. Cities like Portland and Milwaukie even required 90 days. This extended the prior 30-day notice rule, giving tenants more time to adjust or move. HB 2735 in 2007 and later amendments in 2015 laid the groundwork for the 90-day notice standard that became statewide.
