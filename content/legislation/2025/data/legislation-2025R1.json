Requires evidence of eligibility and disability to be provided at the time of application. Sets forth processes for granting one or more preferences. \n\tAllows a public employer to exercise discretion not to appoint a qualified veteran or disabled veteran to a civil service position based solely on the veteran's or disabled veteran's merits or qualification in the final stage of the selection process. Requires a public employer to provide written reasons for not appointing a veteran or disabled veteran to a position under certain circumstances. \n\tRequires an aggrieved veteran or disabled veteran to exhaust nonjudicial remedies with the Bureau of Labor and Industries before filing a civil action for an unlawful employment practice.",
