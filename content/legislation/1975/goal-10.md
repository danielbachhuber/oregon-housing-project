# Goal 10 - Housing

Statewide land-use planning Goal 10 mandates "needed housing" in all communities, requiring local governments to zone land for a variety of housing types and price ranges in every neighborhood. This goal reinforced the 1973 SB 100 planning law and helped combat exclusionary zoning, aligning local plans with state fair housing objectives.
