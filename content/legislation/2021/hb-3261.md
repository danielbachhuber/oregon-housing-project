# HB 3261 - Converting Hotels to Housing

House Bill 3261 (2021) made it easier to repurpose existing buildings to address homelessness. It requires cities to allow the conversion of hotels and motels into emergency shelters or affordable housing "by right," regardless of local zoning. Local governments cannot impose onerous zoning hurdles or conditional use processes on such conversions. This facilitated programs like Project Turnkey, in which motels were purchased and turned into shelters or transitional housing.

Dozens of motel conversions proceeded under this law, rapidly adding units for unsheltered people by using existing structures.
