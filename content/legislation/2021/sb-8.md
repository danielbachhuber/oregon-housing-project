# SB 8

Removed barriers to affordable housing development by allowing affordable housing on commercial, publicly owned, and religiously owned land, and created density bonuses for affordable housing projects.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Measures/Overview/SB8)

## Overview

Senate Bill 8 was a significant land use reform that expanded where affordable housing can be built in Oregon. By allowing affordable housing development on land traditionally zoned for other purposes, SB 8 aimed to increase the supply of buildable land available for affordable housing projects without requiring urban growth boundary expansions.

## Key Provisions

- **Commercial Land**: Allows affordable housing development on land zoned for commercial use.
- **Publicly Owned Land**: Permits affordable housing on publicly owned property.
- **Religiously Owned Land**: Enables religious institutions to develop affordable housing on their property.
- **Density Bonus**: Creates a density bonus for affordable housing projects, allowing more units per acre than would otherwise be permitted.

## Impact

SB 8 provided new tools for affordable housing developers and local governments to address housing shortages. By allowing housing on underutilized commercial and institutional land, the bill created new opportunities for infill development in existing communities rather than requiring expansion into agricultural or natural lands outside urban growth boundaries.

A small technical error in SB 8 was later corrected by [HB 4051 (2022)](/legislation/2022/hb-4051).
