# SB 8 - Affordable Housing on Non-Residential Land

Senate Bill 8 (2021) removed zoning barriers to building affordable housing. It forces local governments to allow affordable housing developments on land zoned for commercial or institutional uses, and on publicly-owned land, without a zone change. Cities cannot deny or reduce the density of qualifying affordable projects based on zoning. SB 8 also grants these projects a density bonus and limits appeals (including making a NIMBY LUBA appeal loser pay the affordable developer's attorney fees).

SB 8 has made it easier and faster for nonprofits to site affordable apartments on underutilized commercial parcels or church-owned land, directly boosting the potential housing supply.
