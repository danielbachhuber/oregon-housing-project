# HB 2006 - Emergency Shelter Siting

Amid a homelessness emergency, HB 2006 (2021) requires cities to approve emergency homeless shelters meeting certain basic criteria "notwithstanding" local zoning codes. Until mid-2023, any proposed emergency shelter in a city had to be processed within 60 days and was exempt from most land-use appeals. This effectively preempted local zoning that might prohibit shelters, enabling rapid opening of new shelters. The law also extended grace to existing shelter sitings.

It acknowledged the homelessness crisis by temporarily suspending red tape for shelters, leading to faster creation of shelter beds statewide.
