# SB 458 - Expanding Middle Housing

A companion to HB 2001 (2019), SB 458 (passed in 2021) made middle housing more practical by allowing lot divisions for middle housing developments. Now, a quadplex or cottage cluster can be split into four fee-simple lots (one per unit) with an expedited partition process, enabling homeownership of each unit. This removed a barrier that had kept many middle housing units as rentals or condos only.
