# SB 458

Middle Housing Land Division bill allowing property owners to divide land to separately own middle housing units created under [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001).

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Measures/Overview/SB458)

## Overview

Senate Bill 458 was a companion bill to the 2019 middle housing legislation ([HB 2001](/legislation/2019/hb-2001)). While HB 2001 required cities to allow duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, and cottage clusters in residential zones, it did not address whether property owners could divide the land to sell individual units separately. SB 458 filled this gap by creating a streamlined land division process for middle housing.

## Key Provisions

- **Land Division Authorization**: Allows property owners to divide land to create separate ownership for each dwelling unit in middle housing developments (duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, cottage clusters, townhomes).
- **Expedited Process**: Requires local governments to make decisions on middle housing land divisions within 63 days after an application is deemed complete.
- **HOA Restrictions Prohibited**: Prohibits homeowners associations and restrictive covenants from forbidding the partition of middle housing land divisions.

## Impact

SB 458 addressed a key barrier to middle housing development. Without the ability to subdivide property, developers had limited options for selling individual middle housing units—they could only sell the entire property or rent individual units. By enabling fee-simple ownership of individual units, SB 458 made middle housing more attractive to both developers and buyers seeking homeownership opportunities.

The bill complements [HB 2001](/legislation/2019/hb-2001)'s goal of creating more diverse and affordable housing options by making ownership of middle housing units more accessible.
