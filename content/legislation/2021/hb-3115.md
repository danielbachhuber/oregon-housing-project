# HB 3115 - Regulating Homeless Camping

Responding to court decisions (Martin v. Boise), HB 3115 (2021) requires that any city or county laws regulating camping or sleeping on public property must be "objectively reasonable" as to time, place, and manner of homeless individuals' behavior. It gave local governments until July 2023 to amend anti-camping ordinances. Essentially, cities can no longer impose blanket anti-homeless bans; any restrictions (like on camping in parks or sidewalks) must be reasonable and allow some form of rest. This statute acknowledged legal rights of unhoused people and pushed Oregon cities toward more humane policies in line with federal court rulings.
