# HB 2558 (Did Not Pass)

Would have required more housing near transit corridors.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Measures/Overview/HB2558)

## Overview

House Bill 2558 would have required increased housing density near transit corridors, following the principle that housing should be concentrated near public transportation to reduce car dependency and support transit ridership. The bill failed to gain the votes needed to move out of committee.

## Key Provisions

- Would have mandated higher housing densities in areas served by frequent transit service
- Aimed to connect land use planning with transportation investments

## Why It Failed

HB 2558 did not advance out of committee during the 2021 session. Similar to other land use reform proposals, the bill faced challenges balancing state housing goals with local land use authority concerns.

## Legacy

The concept of transit-oriented development and requiring more housing near transit continues to be discussed in Oregon housing policy. Elements of this approach have been incorporated into subsequent legislation and local planning efforts, including provisions in [HB 2001 (2023)](/legislation/2023/hb-2001) related to housing needs analysis and production strategies.
