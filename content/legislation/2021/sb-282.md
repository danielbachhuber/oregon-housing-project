# SB 282 & SB 278 - COVID-19 Renter Protections

During the pandemic, Oregon passed temporary measures (SB 282 and SB 278 in 2021) to prevent mass evictions. SB 282 extended tenants' grace period to repay back rent accrued during COVID until Feb 28, 2022 and protected renters from eviction for having unpaid 2020–21 rent if they were making efforts to pay. It also allowed tenants to have longer guest stays (to double up housing) and to expunge COVID-era evictions. SB 278 provided a 60-day stay on eviction proceedings for nonpayment if the tenant showed proof of applying for rental assistance.

These were emergency responses and have sunset, but they prevented thousands of evictions and influenced the permanent reforms in 2023.
