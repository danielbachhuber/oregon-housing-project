# SB 282

COVID-19 tenant protection bill extending grace periods for rent accrued during the pandemic emergency and prohibiting negative credit reporting for nonpayment.

[Original Bill Text](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Measures/Overview/SB282)

## Overview

Senate Bill 282 was enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect tenants who had accumulated unpaid rent during the emergency period. The bill created a grace period for repayment and prevented landlords from taking certain adverse actions against tenants who had fallen behind on rent due to pandemic-related financial hardship.

## Key Provisions

- **Grace Period Extension**: Extended the grace period for repayment of residential rent accrued during the emergency period (April 2020 - June 2021) through February 2022.
- **Credit Reporting Protection**: Prohibited landlords from reporting to consumer credit reporting agencies a tenant's nonpayment of rent, charges, or fees that accrued on or after April 1, 2020.
- **Eviction Protections**: Provided additional protections against eviction for tenants with pandemic-related rent debt.

## Context

SB 282 was part of Oregon's broader response to the housing instability created by the COVID-19 pandemic. It worked in conjunction with [SB 278](/legislation/2021/sb-278), which provided an additional 60-day eviction protection notice requirement for rent assistance delivery. These protections built on [SB 608 (2019)](/legislation/2019/sb-608)'s existing tenant protections while addressing the unique circumstances of the pandemic.

## Impact

The bill helped prevent a wave of evictions that could have resulted from accumulated pandemic-era rent debt, giving tenants time to access emergency rental assistance programs and recover financially.
