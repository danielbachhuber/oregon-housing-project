# SB 291 - Fairness in Tenant Screening

Senate Bill 291 (2021) tackled housing access for people with criminal records. It requires landlords to conduct individualized assessments of rental applicants with criminal history rather than automatically rejecting them. Landlords must consider factors like the nature and age of the offense and evidence of rehabilitation. This "fair chance housing" law aims to reduce blanket exclusions that disproportionately harm minority renters, helping those exiting the justice system to secure housing.
