# Rent Control Preemption - ORS 91.225

Made the 1983 rent control ban permanent. Under ORS 91.225, cities and counties were forbidden from enacting ordinances that "control the rent" landlords may charge. This state preemption (enacted at the behest of realtors and property owners) barred local rent caps for over three decades – until Oregon's own statewide rent control in 2019.
