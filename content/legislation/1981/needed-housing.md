# Needed Housing Requirements

Enacted statutes requiring clear and objective standards for housing development applications. Incorporated the "St. Helens rule" to stop towns from excluding multifamily or lower-cost homes. Local governments must provide an easy, non-discretionary approval path for housing, which sped up permits and curtailed NIMBY delays.
