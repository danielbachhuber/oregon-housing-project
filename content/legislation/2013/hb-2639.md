# HB 2639 - Source-of-Income Anti-Discrimination

In 2013 Oregon added "source of income" as a protected class in housing. This ban on Section 8 voucher discrimination (effective 2014) made it unlawful for landlords to refuse to rent to someone solely because they use a housing voucher. The law also created a Landlord Guarantee Program to reimburse landlords for up to $5,000 in damages caused by voucher tenants – an incentive to encourage acceptance of low-income renters. This was a key tenant protection expanding housing access for thousands of voucher-holders.
