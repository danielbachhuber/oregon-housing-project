# Oregon Housing & Community Services Department

In 1991 the state merged its housing agency with anti-poverty programs to form OHCS (O.L. 1991, ch.739). This elevated housing policy within state government and linked housing programs with community services like homeless assistance and energy aid. OHCS became the central agency for affordable housing loans, grants, and tax credit programs (e.g. federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits).
