# HB 2967 - Housing Trust Fund & Homeless Assistance

Oregon's first housing trust fund, the Housing Development and Guarantee Account, was created in 1991 to finance low-income housing construction and rehabilitation. The same legislation established the Emergency Housing Account to fund shelter and services for people experiencing homelessness. These trust funds, fed by document recording fees and other sources, have since supported hundreds of affordable housing projects and emergency shelter programs statewide.
