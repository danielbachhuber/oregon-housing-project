The Oregon Housing Project's mission is to explore the topic of housing in Oregon at depth in a way that makes the topic accessible to more people. When it presents analysis, the project is biased towards these opinions:

* Oregon isn't building enough housing.
* Oregon's housing is too expensive.
* At least some of Oregon's regulatory approach is counter-productive; adding regulation paradoxically slows the rate of building and/or makes it more expensive.

The majority of the research depth focuses on Oregon. As appropriate, examples from other states are included as a point of reference.

## Governance

All of the work product receives a human review before being published.
