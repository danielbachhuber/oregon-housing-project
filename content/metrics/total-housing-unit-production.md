# Total Housing Unit Production

Total Housing Unit Production is a key metric for tracking Oregon's progress toward addressing its housing shortage. The state has established ambitious goals and measurement systems to monitor how many new housing units are being built each year.

## How Housing Production is Measured

Oregon measures "produced" housing units as **units that have received a temporary or final certificate of occupancy**, not just building permits.[^1] This provides a more accurate measure of actually completed and habitable units rather than just authorized construction.

### Reporting Requirements

Under [HB 2001](/legislation/2023/hb-2001) (2023), Oregon cities with populations of 10,000 or more must:[^2]

- Submit annual housing production reports to the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD)
- Report both units permitted (building permits issued) and units produced (certificate of occupancy issued)
- Cover the previous calendar year in their reports
- Submit reports by February 1st each year

The state publishes a Housing Production Dashboard (first published January 1, 2025) to track progress toward production targets, which is updated annually.[^3]

## Current Production Numbers

In 2024, Oregon authorized **14,621 new housing units**.[^4]

This falls significantly short of the state's goals established by [Executive Order 23-04](/legislation/2023/eo-23-04):

- Original EO 23-04 goal: 36,000 units per year
- Current revised goal based on Oregon Housing Needs Analysis: 29,522 units per year

At current production levels, Oregon is building approximately **50% of the housing units** needed to meet the state's identified housing needs.

## Affordable Housing Production

For state-supported affordable housing specifically, Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) funded the creation or preservation of:[^5]

- 4,806 affordable rental homes in 2025 (50% increase from 2024)
- 3,208 affordable homes in 2024
- Nearly 14,000 affordable homes financed or opened with state support during the Kotek administration

## Target-Setting Methodology

The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) developed a methodology to:[^6]

- Estimate the state's total number of housing units needed over a 20-year time period
- Set housing production benchmarks for cities with 10,000 or more people
- Publish the methodology and production targets annually, starting in January 2025
