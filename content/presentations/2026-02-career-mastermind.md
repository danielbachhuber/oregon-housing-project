CHART DATA: Up for Growth, "Housing Underproduction in the U.S." 2024 report, state-level dataset (https://upforgrowth.org/apply-the-vision/housing-underproduction-reports/). "Units needed" = total housing units + estimated underproduction. "Units built" = total housing units from Census data. The gap between the two lines is the underproduction estimate.

METHODOLOGY: Underproduction is calculated using the Up for Growth methodology, which Oregon's OHNA adopted (OHNA 2026 Results Report, p. 5, Figure 4). It compares the target number of housing units a market should have (based on households, missing household formation since 2000, and uninhabitable units) against actual units available for year-round occupancy. Regions where demand exceeds supply are experiencing underproduction.

KEY NUMBERS: The gap grew from ~34,000 units in 2012 to ~88,000 in 2018. By 2022 it was ~78,000 (Up for Growth 2024 dataset, "States" tab). The 2026 OHNA estimates current statewide underproduction at 50,191 units (OHNA 2026 Results Report, p. 29, Figure 15), with a total 20-year need of 491,347 units and an annual production target of 29,359 units (OHNA 2026 Results Report, p. 28). Oregon ranked 3rd-8th worst among all states for underproduction as a share of housing stock from 2012-2022 (Up for Growth 2024 dataset, "States" tab, RANK_BY_UNDERPRODUCTION_SHARE_OF_UNITS column).
