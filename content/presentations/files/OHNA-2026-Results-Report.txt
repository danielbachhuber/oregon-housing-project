Report Overview
This report contains the 2026 statewide and local housing production targets along with a
description of the OHNA Methodology. Due to the federal government shutdown in October
and November of 2025, many of the foundational data sources used in the methodology were
delayed from their typical release schedule. Additionally, some of the sources (primarily used
in the local allocation methodology) have infrequent and unannounced release dates, making it
not always possible to update the data sources from the last annual report. These data
limitations will be documented in detail. Other than data update limitations, the only planned
update to the methodology involved a change from a two year to a three year moving average
of the annual need to create the 2026 20-year total need and the annual production target.

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Oregon Housing Needs Analysis Methodology
The OHNA Methodology focuses on the affordability and geographic distribution of newly
produced housing, not the characteristics of the existing housing stock across the state. This
is a methodological choice that has implications for policymaking and tracking the overall
affordability of the entire housing stock. The Final Methodology incorporates multiple
considerations to reflect different types of demand on current and future housing need. The
OHNA Methodology has six steps:
1. Determine Regions
2. Determine Income Categories
3. Determine Components of Housing Need
4. Allocate Needed Housing to Income Categories
5. Allocate Needed Housing to Cities and UGBs
6. Set Housing Production Targets
Step 1: Determine Regions
The first step in completing the OHNA is to define the regions for the analysis. The regions
affect the entire analysis, from the ability to develop the analysis based on available data to
the interpretation of the findings about regional housing needs for individual cities. Since each
possible dataset that could be used to define regions has its own level of geographic
specificity, choices about regions are integrally tied to choices about data.
Defining regions for this analysis required identifying the source of data that would be used
throughout the analysis. The source of data needs to be consistently available statewide,
available at an appropriate geographic level, updated annually, have acceptable margins of
error for the variables of interest for the methodology, and be flexible enough to allow for
comparisons necessary to deliver the analysis required by the statute. While the methodology
is structured to account for limitations in available data, future iterations of the methodology
could benefit from improvements in state access to data sources, such as a statewide parcel
database of standardized assessor’s data or a statewide rental registry that included
information on costs and accessibility.
Regions
Figure 1 shows the regions in the OHNA Final Methodology. The OHNA regions are built from
Census Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) regions using data from the 2022 vintage of data.
PUMA regions shown in white outline, are aggregated up to the OHNA regions, shown in color.
The U.S. Census Bureau updates PUMAs every 10 years following the Decennial Census; future
changes to PUMA boundaries may affect the OHNA regions in the future.

Figure 3. OHNA Regions (PUMA boundaries denoted in white)

Step 2: Determine Income Categories
The second step is to define the income categories that are used to distribute needed housing
across the income spectrum. The OHNA Methodology uses Area Median Income (AMI) limits
that were stated in ORS 184.453(4):
(a) Less than 30%
(b) 30% or more and less than 60%
(c) 60% or more and less than 80%
(d) 80% or more and less than 120%
(e) 120% or more
These income categories align with common funding sources, including OHCS’s programs, for
subsidized affordable housing. It's important to note that the distribution of households in
each income category is not equal.
The methodology uses regional incomes to allocate housing need to individual jurisdictions.
This is an important change from prior Goal 10 planning requirements in which jurisdictions
used their own city-level incomes to estimate housing need by income level. The effect of this
change is that local governments will be required to plan for a share of the region's estimated
housing needs by income, rather than locally estimating and planning for housing needs by
income only within the boundaries of the local government.

3

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Income categories translate into housing affordability. Income categories are expressed as a
percent of AMI, which is determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) and takes into account household size and the number of bedrooms. A
housing unit is determined to be affordable to a household if it accounts for less than 30% of
that household’s gross income.
Across the Final Methodology, all income categories are adjusted to account for household
size. HUD provides regional AMIs based on a four-person household and provides guidance to
allow practitioners to adjust for household size and number of bedrooms in a unit,1 which is as
follows:
Household Size Income Adjustment
• 1-person household: 70% of AMI
• 2-person household: 80% of AMI
• 3-person household: 90% of AMI
• 4-person household: 100% of AMI
• 5-person household: 108% of AMI
Apartment Unit Size Income Adjustment
• Studio unit: 70% of AMI
• 1-bedroom unit: 75% of AMI
• 2-bedroom unit: 90% of AMI
• 3-bedroom unit: 104% of AMI
Step 3: Determine Components of Need
The third step of the OHNA is to determine the different components of housing need. The
OHNA is an estimate of total housing needed statewide over a 20-year horizon and includes
housing units that are needed now to house the existing population (Current Need) as well as
units needed in the future to accommodate household growth (Future Need).
•
•

Current Need includes housing underproduction and housing units for people
experiencing homelessness.
Future Need includes units for expected population growth, expected housing units that
will be lost to second and vacation homes, and units to accommodate expected
demographic change.

By including an estimate of current housing need in planning requirements, the OHNA departs
from historic Goal 10 planning requirements which only required jurisdictions to look forward
at the 20-year population forecast. The Final Methodology recognizes that Oregon has been
underbuilding housing for several decades and that a narrow focus solely on future population

growth will not help communities relieve the pressures created in housing markets by low
vacancy rates and high prices.
Current Need
The OHNA is an estimate of total housing needed statewide over a 20-year planning horizon,
including an estimate of how many units the state, regions, and cities need currently to
adequately house their existing populations. Current need takes into account housing
underproduction and units needed for people experiencing homelessness.
Housing Underproduction
The Final Methodology adopts with some minor modifications of an approach used by Up for
Growth, a housing policy research nonprofit in Washington, D.C., that has been vetted by
housing industry experts.2 This approach calculates the target number of housing units a
region’s market should have (demand) and compares that against the actual number of units
that market has available for year-round occupancy (supply). These steps are broken down
below. Regions where the demand exceeds supply are experiencing housing underproduction.
Figure 4. Up for Growth Housing Underproduction Methodology

Target Number of Housing Units
The estimate of the target number of housing units starts with the Census Bureau’s estimate
of total households and then estimates the number of “missing households” that have not
formed in a market compared to historical formation rates in 2000.
Household formation is influenced by the housing stock available—when a market does not
build sufficient housing, prices rise and vacancy falls, affecting the likelihood of households to
form (e.g., roommates splitting up, children moving out, etc.). This measure estimates the
number of households that are expected to form in less constrained housing market
conditions, and as such are a component of current demand.
The Final Methodology calculates “missing households” based on changes in the headship
rate (the percentage of people who are heads of households, or householders) for different
2

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
age cohorts between 18 and 64. The lack of housing availability and affordability is not the
only reason that explains reduced household formation rates, therefore including all age
cohorts would be an overcount of household formation primarily caused by housing market
constraints. Age cohorts are therefore limited to head of households between 18 and 64 as the
most likely ages where this occurs—effectively excluding head of households over 65 is one
way to limit the impact of the overcount. Limiting the age cohorts helps compensate for the
nature of the overcount–essentially that housing isn’t the only factor contributing to decreased
household formation rates. The standard UFG approach limits age cohorts over the age of 44,
the expansion of head of households to the age of 64 acknowledges circumstances unique to
Oregon’s housing market, and the fact that working households of all ages are experiencing
the impacts of a constrained, underproduced housing market.
The OHNA Methodology uses a baseline headship rate in the year 2000 for all cohorts. This
year was chosen because 2000 Decennial Census data offers the most recent statistically
reliable estimate of a housing market that was more in balance. Headship rates were also
generally stable between 1980 and 2000, so going back further would not have a large impact
on the baseline headship rate. The Final Methodology compares the most recent headship rate
(based on 2024 PUMS data) against the 2000 baseline for each age cohort. If a cohort has a
lower headship rate in the most recent year compared to the baseline, it indicates that fewer
households formed. The total estimate of “missing households” is the sum of reduced
household formation from cohorts aged 64 years and younger. Should there be negative
missing households (more households formed compared to the baseline rate) in any age
cohort, they are netted out to zero because they are not contributing to excess demand beyond
what is already captured in the households formed data observation.
The estimate of missing households is added to the current total number of households to
approximate the total number of households that would be seeking housing in unconstrained
market conditions. The model then applies a 5% target vacancy rate to estimate the total
number of housing units a region should have to accommodate current need and have a
healthy level of vacancy. Five percent vacancy is the 75th percentile of the national vacancy
rate between 1980 and 2000 and is meant to represent unconstrained market conditions. It is
backed by industry stakeholder outreach and research and is used in other methodologies of
estimating housing need and underproduction.
Actual Units Available for Year-Round Occupancy
The estimate of the actual number of units available for year-round occupancy starts with the
Census Bureau’s estimate of total housing units and removes uninhabitable units and second
and vacation homes that are not available for year-round occupancy from the stock.
Uninhabitable units are identified in the Census PUMS data as those that lack indoor plumbing
and complete kitchens, and that have been vacant for at least a year. Second and vacation
homes are identified in the Census Bureau as those that are vacant and used for “seasonal or
recreational purposes.”
By removing uninhabitable units and second and vacation homes from the estimate of the
current housing stock, the Final Methodology attempts to calculate each region’s total housing
6

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
stock available for year-round occupancy as a more accurate reflection of housing supply.
When compared to the total number of households each region would have in unconstrained
market conditions, the Final Methodology can capture current housing underproduction and
incorporate current housing need into future planning purposes. This change pushes Oregon’s
statewide housing planning system toward one that more accurately measures total housing
need; planning for future housing need without accounting for current need will continue to
yield insufficient housing production relative to demand across the state.
Housing Units Needed for People Experiencing Homelessness
DAS and OHCS engaged the Portland State University (PSU) Homeless Research and Action
Collaborative (HRAC) to develop the methodology to estimate housing units needed for people
experiencing homelessness. The HRAC methodology uses an annualized point in time count
of unsheltered households, the number of households served in shelter over a year, and
households doubled-up based on K-12 student data and U.S. Census data.
Determining the number of units a region needs to house people experiencing homelessness
requires careful attention, because available datasets have many known limitations including
undercounting populations. Populations experiencing homelessness are generally not
captured in foundational datasets derived from the Census, so they are not included in the
projections of current (or future) need. This methodological choice was made under the
assumption that if jurisdictions can plan for current need as the sum of underproduction and
housing for people experiencing homelessness, while planning for enough housing units to
meet future need, then homelessness would become “functionally zero,” and would be rare
and brief.3
The Final Methodology relies heavily on the limited research available on this topic, as well as
discussion and feedback from stakeholders with expertise in research and service provision
for those experiencing homelessness in Oregon. The state continues to explore new research
and better data to continually improve this portion of the OHNA methodology. 4
The HRAC methodology combines portions of four data sets to better estimate the number of
people experiencing homelessness in an OHNA region. The approach uses Continuum of Care
(CoC) Point-In-Time Count (PITC) data and McKinney-Vento Student Data (MVSD) for children
enrolled in K-12 public schools. It also utilizes CoC Homeless Management Information
System (HMIS) data, By-Name Lists (BNL), and American Community Survey (ACS) data.
To calculate the number of households who need housing, the HRAC methodology combines:
• Unsheltered data: PITC unsheltered data that is annualized and converted to household
numbers; or the household count from BNL across one year;

does not exceed the community’s proven record of housing at least that many people in a month.”

Recommendations for improving data are included in Chapter 7 of the OHCS RHNA Technical Report and
Appendix B describes the key analytical issues in estimating the amount of housing need to accommodate the
population of people experiencing homelessness in Oregon

Sheltered data: Households served in shelter over one calendar year, as recorded in
HMIS; and,
Doubled-up data: MVSD for doubled-up student households plus ACS doubled-up
households without children enrolled in K-12 schools.

All data are converted to households (HH), and annualized when the data set is not an annual
count. Each household is assumed to occupy one housing unit, thereby producing the estimate
of the number of housing units needed. See Appendix C for a copy of the complete memo
detailing the HRAC methodology.
Future Need
The OHNA is an estimate of total housing needed statewide over a 20-year planning horizon.
Future need takes into account the housing units needed for population growth, housing units
lost to second and vacation home demand, and housing units needed to accommodate
demographic change.
Housing Units for Population Growth
To estimate 20-year future housing needs, forecasted population growth must be translated
into future households and then translated into future needed housing units.
PSU’s Population Research Center (PRC) produces the official population estimates for the
State of Oregon with the exception of the Portland Metro Region.5 The Final Methodology
converts the PRC population forecast to households using the most recent regional average
household size estimated with the most recent PUMS data.
As with past Goal 10 housing planning requirements, the OHNA Methodology excludes the
estimate of people living in group quarters because they are not considered part of the
household population, and their needs are planned for separately. Each region’s base-year
population estimates are reduced by the 2023 PUMS-derived share of population in group
quarters, before converting population to households. For the horizon year forecasts, the
model uses 2024 PUMS to calculate a group quarters rate by age cohort and apply it to
regions’ 2045 age cohort forecasts to arrive at an overall regional group quarters rate. Since
most regions’ forecast a greater share of older cohorts in 2045, the OHNA currently models
slight increases in overall group quarter rates for all regions in the horizon year.
The loss of units to second and vacation homes in the future is calculated as a separate
component of need (see next section), therefore the Final Methodology assumes that each
future household will occupy one housing unit, while also planning for the target vacancy rate.
Once total future needed housing units are determined, the Final Methodology applies the

Metro is responsible for issuing population forecasts within the Metro urban growth boundary, which serve as
the basis for comprehensive and land use plans (see ORS 195.036). The Metro allocation methodology, outlined
later in this document, is based on housing needs estimates for the Metro UGB in Metro's Urban Growth Report.

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
same 5% vacancy factor to estimate the future housing stock that cities and regions should
plan for (see page 6).
Housing Units Lost to Second and Vacation Home Demand
Estimating second and vacation homes as its own component allows cities to better account
for demand for these housing units in the future and improves the State’s understanding of the
role that second and vacation homes play in each region’s housing market. In many outdoor
recreation- and tourist-heavy communities, particularly along the coast, in the Gorge, and in
central Oregon, the presence of second and vacation homes removes units of the existing
housing stock from year-round occupants at a different rate than in other parts of the state.
This contributes to underproduction of needed housing by reducing the number of units
available to full-time renters and owners, thereby decreasing vacancy rates and putting upward
pressure on housing costs. As the stock of second and vacation homes grows in the future, it
effectively takes away from housing production, as fewer units are available for year-round
occupancy.
Summary of Process to Identify Second and Vacation Homes
1. Calculate change in the number of second and vacation homes per region
2. Determine how much housing is needed to offset this expected future loss in units
3. Apply the ratio to forecasted housing unit growth
The current share of second and vacation homes varies by region, as does the pace at which
these shares are changing over time. First, the model calculates the change in the number of
second and vacation homes for each region between the years 2000 and 2020. The growth in
second and vacation homes is then contextualized by the number of all housing units added
for each region between 2000 and 2020. The ratio of second and vacation homes added
compared to the total housing production is calculated for each region. This ratio is effectively
an approximation of how much additional production would be required to offset the loss in
units to second and vacation home demand over the 20-year planning period. In practice, a
jurisdiction could implement policies to reduce the growth of second and vacation homes or
target the production of additional units to offset the loss of units available for year-round
occupancy.
Example Calculation for Second and Vacation Home Demand
If a city produced 1,000 housing units between 2000 and 2020 but saw the number of
second and vacation homes in the same time period grow from 100 to 200 units (either
through new construction or conversion of an existing home), then it would have a ratio of
0.1 ((200-100)/1000). If this city was expected to grow by 2,500 households over twenty
years, the additional production to account for units lost to second and vacation home need
would be 0.1 * 2,500 or 250 units.

9

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
The Final Methodology only calculates second and vacation homes as part of determining
future housing need. These units are no longer available for year-round occupancy, and as
units are purpose-built or converted into second and vacation homes, the progress toward the
desired number of units per household or target vacancy rate is lessened. Units identified as
being currently occupied as second and vacation homes are captured as part of the
underproduction calculation (current need).

Housing Units for Demographic Change
The number of housing units needed to account for demographic change helps to account for
changing household demographic composition as the population of Oregon changes.
Like many states, Oregon is aging, and seniors typically have smaller household sizes;
according to Census data, the average household size (persons per household, PPH) headed
by a person aged 60 to 69 is only 1.9 people, compared to 2.9 people for households headed
by a person aged 30-39. As population forecasts expect a larger share of the population to be
65 and older, and as the fertility rate continues to remain below replacement rate, more
housing units will be needed to house Oregon’s older total future population. An example
below depicts how demographic change is handled in the model.
First, the Final Methodology uses PUMS data to calculate the current PPH for each major age
cohort by region. It then joins the age cohort-based PPH figures to the 2025 and 2045
population forecasts by age cohort and then calculates a total PPH for each region for 2025
and 2045. Average household sizes for each region are forecast to be smaller due to changing
demographics.
The PRC-forecasted populations in each region in 2025 and 2045 are then converted into
households by dividing by the average household size in each region. This differs from the
population change component, where the PPH is held constant between the baseline and
horizon years (using 2025 PPH).
The final step in the process is to convert the added number of households in each region into
needed housing units. Following the methodology for the other components, the Final
Methodology also applies the target 5% vacancy factor to the estimated number of needed
housing units in the future (see page 6).
Example Regional Demographic Change
1. (Population2045 ÷ PPH2025) – (Population2025 ÷ PPH2025) = Households added by
Population Change
2. (Population2045 ÷ PPH2045) – (Population2025 ÷ PPH2025) – Households added by
Population Change = Households added by Demographic Change
10

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
3. Households added by Demographic Change x 1.05 = Housing Units Needed to
Account for Demographic Change

The demographic change component is effectively capturing the change in household size for
existing households (starting in 2025) as well as the marginal new households added between
2025 and 2045. This is a deviation from other components in that it considers housing need
for existing and future households. It is included in the future need category because it
captures future demand for housing from existing households (rather than underproduction
and homelessness, which are current demand).
Step 4: Allocate Needed Housing to Income Categories
Once total housing units needed are estimated for each component and each region, the next
step is to distribute housing need to income categories. Allocation processes differ by
component.
Current Need: Housing Underproduction
Underproduced units are allocated to income categories based on the rate of cost burdened
renter households in each region. Cost burdening is a good proxy to estimate the income
levels where current housing is in most need. Underproduction in a market leads to increased
cost burdening by limiting choice and reducing overall affordability, and these impacts are
most acutely experienced by lower-income renter households who have the highest rates of
cost burdening. Underproduced units are therefore distributed proportionate to rates of
regional cost burdening to approximate the income levels with the most acute need. For
example, if 50% of all renter households who are cost burdened earn 0-30% of AMI, then 50%
of the underproduction units should be targeted for households earning 0-30% of AMI. The
model uses 2024 PUMS to first isolate cost-burdened renter households in each region, and
from there, calculate the proportion of these cost-burdened households in each AMI household
income bracket.
Current Need: Housing Units Needed for People Experiencing Homelessness
Housing units needed for people experiencing homelessness are distributed by income
based on information provided from OHCS. There is no existing, high-quality dataset
with information about the incomes of people who are experiencing homelessness, but
many households that are experiencing homelessness have incomes and still cannot
find a home that is affordable to them.
The Final Methodology uses data on the incomes of people experiencing homelessness from
HMIS information managed by Continuums of Care. The data are from 2024 and are regional.
Statewide, of households whose incomes are captured in the data, a large portion (77%) are in
the lowest income category of 0-30% AMI. The regional distributions by income are shown in
Figure 5.

Future Need: Housing Units for Population Growth
Units needed to accommodate population growth are allocated based on each region’s current
income distribution. The state’s income distribution and that of each region are shown in
Figure 6 below.
Figure 6. Income Distributions for Oregon and Each OHNA Region, 2025

12

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology

Future Need: Housing Units Lost to Second and Vacation Home Demand
PUMS data does not provide rent or valuation data for units identified as second and vacation
homes, but data on the year built are available and are used as a proxy for valuation with the
assumption that newer units are more expensive and should be allocated to the highest
income categories. The OHNA methodology allocates units identified as second and vacation
homes that were built prior to 1990 to the 80-120% AMI income category while those built after
1990 are allocated to the 120%+ AMI income category. This distribution was determined
based on a PUMS analysis of regional patterns of affordability of occupied homes by year
built.
Future Need: Housing Units Needed for Demographic Change
Given the similarities between units needed for population growth and units needed for
demographic change, units needed for demographic changes are also allocated to income
categories based on each region’s income distribution.
Step 5: Allocate Needed Housing to Cities and UGBs
After the total housing units needed over 20 years is calculated, the fifth step in the
methodology is to determine what needed housing should be allocated to areas inside or
outside of Urban Growth Boundaries. The Portland Metro region has a different allocation
methodology (see page 20). While the Salem-Keizer area has two cities within one UGB, PRC
provides city-level population projections for both Salem and Keizer, preventing the need to
create a separate allocation process for this UGB.
Step A. Determine Regional Need Inside vs. Outside UGBs
13

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
First, the 20-year future population growth outside of UGBs is determined for each region. This
is based on PRC forecasts which report outside-UGB subtotals for every county. This step
recognizes that not all Oregonians live inside UGBs, and not all Oregonians will live inside
UGBs in the future. Lands outside a UGB receive a future housing estimate to reflect projected
demand, but do not receive any current need allocations. Current need is a symptom of a lack
of enough housing units within the planned areas of growth. Areas outside of UGBs are rural
and resource lands and generally do not plan for housing growth under the statewide land use
system; therefore, the responsibility for providing additional housing units to meet current
need is accommodated inside of UGBs.
Second, units that accommodate population growth, demographic change, and demand for
second and vacation homes outside UGBs are removed from the regional total. The remaining
units are then allocated to UGBs inside the region.
Step B. Allocating Regional Need to Urban Growth Boundaries
Next, each component of need is allocated from the adjusted regional total (excluding areas
outside of UGBs) to each of the UGBs in the region using a set of policy variables and weights
in the following combinations. ORS 184.453 requires the methodology to allocate housing
need to each city in consideration of forecasted population growth, regional job distribution,
and an equitable statewide distribution of housing. The allocation weights below
operationalize this direction to align with the policy priorities set forth by the legislature,
balancing where people currently live, where the PSU population forecasts expect people to
live, and where the region’s jobs are located. Second and vacation home allocations focus
those housing units where the housing markets are most directly impacted today. Including an
area’s share of jobs as a weight in the allocation is a policy choice driven by Oregon’s desire to
create compact livable communities with access to jobs and amenities. Locating housing
closer to jobs also helps support Oregon's climate and emissions reductions goals.

vacation homes spatially joined to UGB boundaries)
Step C. Distribute from Urban Growth Boundaries to Cities
This is only applicable in the Portland Metro UGB, which contains multiple jurisdictions (see
page 20).
Step 6: Set Housing Production Targets
Once the total housing need is determined, the final (sixth) step of the methodology is to set
targets for housing production. In early 2023, Governor Tina Kotek issued Executive Order 2304 to establish an annual statewide housing production goal. Based on this policy objective
and using the same formula as the Governor’s housing production goal, the OHNA Final
Methodology prioritizes and front-loads the current need over 10 years and spreads the future
need over the 20-year OHNA planning horizon to calculate the annual production target. An
example calculation of an annual production target is shown below using statewide total
housing need. The same calculations apply for calculating the production targets for each city
and each income level.
Example Annual Housing Production Target Calculation Using Statewide Results
See page 24 more detail on the statewide results by component.
Total Need: 491,347 units
Current Need: 95,828 units
Future Need: 395,519 units
Annual Production Target:
[Current Need / 10 years] + [Future Need / 20 years]
[95,828 units / 10 years] + [395,519 units / 20 years]
= 9,583 units + 19,776 units
= 29,359units per year

In order to produce annual targets for each jurisdiction that are more stable from year to year,
DAS runs the OHNA Methodology each year and averages the current year’s results with the
prior two year’s results. In the 2025 production targets, this wasn’t possible due to the lack of 3
years of annual targets, therefore the 2026 annual production target is the first vintage where
the 3 year moving average has been implemented. The intention with smoothing the data is to
prevent OHNA targets from jumping around significantly from year to year due to data
volatility, allowing local jurisdictions to have more consistent information for planning
purposes. In this case the 2026 production target is the average of 2023, 2024, and 2025
15

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
annual targets. The smoothing process will be challenging when PUMA boundaries change
again in 2032, and a technical update may be required at that point in time.
Peer Cities
OHCS must produce a Housing Production Dashboard, which must include, for each city with a
population of 10,000 or greater, “a comparative analysis of progress in comparison to the
region and other local governments with similar market types” which are referred to as “peer
cities.”6 DLCD must base referral decisions to the Housing Acceleration Program on a city's
relative progress and performance towards housing production targets.7 The following
housing market attributes that indicate market similarity were used to group cities into peers:
1. Current population size (static)
2. Share of households with incomes >$200,000 (static)
3. Share of housing used as second and vacation homes (static)
4. Share of housing that is single unit detached (static)
5. Share of housing that is owner-occupied (static)
6. Population growth between 2010 and 2020 (percent change)
The methodology uses a statistical analysis called a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to group each
city with seven other peers based on their shared conditions across the seven variables listed
above (see Figure 7 for the list of peers). The KNN algorithm uses place‐level ACS and
Decennial Census population estimates data as inputs, and each input is equally weighted.
This approach allows for each city to be compared to its seven “closest” peers. This approach
offers several advantages including a consistent number of peer cities, and for each city to be
grouped with its best fitting peers.
KNN calculates a matrix of Euclidean distances between each pair of cities (the square root of
the sum of squared differences for every variable). Some city pairs are socioeconomically and
demographically “closer,” or more similar to each other than others. As Euclidean distance
increases, the potential fit as a peer decreases. A common rule of thumb for KNN is to limit
neighbor groupings to the square root of the total number of samples in the set. In this case,
the KNN model contains 58 cities (and Tillamook County) that have a population over 10,000
in Oregon, indicating that 7 nearest neighbors is the optimal number for the OHNA application.
Not every local government defined as a "city with a population of 10,000 or greater" can be
readily paired with market peers utilizing this methodology. This includes:
● Urban unincorporated lands within Metro counties: The peer methodology omits these
local governments because they are non-standard and not reflected in any Census

6

“City” is used as shorthand for the jurisdictions that will receive peers. See ORS 456.601(3)b:
https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors456.html

geographic unit. The closes approximation would be to use aggregation of census
tracts, but these cross into other incorporated cities.
● Cities and specified unincorporated communities within the Tillamook County: While SB
406 (2023) defines these communities as "cities with a population of 10,000 or greater"
for the purpose of housing planning, they are not large enough to have suitable Census
data to be included in the peer methodology and are therefore grouped together.

Updating the Methodology
Since producing the first official needs estimates and production targets in 2025, DAS plans to
revisit the methodology at least every five years. The law also allows OHCS and DLCD to
recommend changes to the OHNA Methodology, provided that the agencies provide an
opportunity for written and oral testimony on proposed recommendations.

19

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Portland Metro Region
The law codifying the OHNA into the statewide land use planning system treats the Portland
Metro UGB differently from the rest of the state. Under HB2889 (2023) Metro maintains its
statutory responsibility to estimate the region’s housing need within the Metro UGB, while DAS
is made responsible for allocating that need to Metro cities and urban, unincorporated lands
(UULs).8
OHNA Metro UGB Suballocation Methodology Steps
In the OHNA methodology, every region, except for the Portland Metro Region uses a top-down
estimation of need, followed by a local jurisdiction allocation process for all UGB’s and nonUGB areas within the region. The Portland Metro Region is composed of Multnomah,
Washington, and Clackamas counties. The Metro UGB is the growth boundary sitting inside the
three counties, determined by Metro to separate urban and urbanizable land from rural land.
Figure 8. Map of OHNA Metro Region (Three Counties), Metro Region Outside UGB, and
Metro UGB Areas

The OHNA methodology estimates the Portland Metro Region’s total housing need (areas in
red outline in Figure 8) in the same manner as all other regions in the state, but then swaps in

8

See ORS 184.453(3)(e) which requires DAS to consider Metro’s projected housing needs and ORS 197A.348(2)
which requires Metro to project housing need for the components of need that are included in the OHNA.

20

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Metro’s own estimate of current and future housing need from its Urban Growth Report (UGR)9
for the units needed inside the Metro UGB (areas in orange in Figure 8). The estimates of
housing units needed in the Metro Region Outside UGB area (the blue remainder in Figure 8)
are held constant so any changes related to a control total inside the Metro UGB do not impact
the need in the rest of the region.
Step A: Determining Need for Metro UGB
The OHNA uses Metro’s estimate of current and future housing need from its 2024 adopted
UGR for the units needed inside the Metro UGB.
Planning for housing need inside the Metro UGB is determined separately from the rest of the
OHNA Metro Region. The OHNA Metro Region’s current and future need is calculated in the
same manner as all other regions. However, within the OHNA Metro Region future and current
need is allocated to UGBs using an amended methodology different from all other regions.
Current and future need is first determined for the Metro Region Outside UGB Areas (including
the cities of Sandy, Estacada, Canby, Molalla, Barlow, Gaston, Banks, and North Plains), and the
county areas outside of all UGBs separately. Then the estimate of current and future need
within the Metro UGB is determined using Metro’s adopted UGR, which includes an estimate of
total future need from “household growth” (population growth and demographic change
combined) along with estimates of need for underproduction, second and vacation homes, and
units to address homelessness.
To align the Metro UGB need with the rest of OHNA, the UGR-calculated “household growth”
need is split into population growth and demographic change components, and across
household income brackets using the pre-existing distributions from the rest of the OHNA
Metro Region. The rest of the Metro UGR-calculated components are swapped into the model
for the Metro UGB as-is and allocated along the same regional income distributions.
Oregon statute requires that Metro must coordinate its regional forecasts with governments
within the UGB. These growth forecast distributions are used to update land use and
transportation plans, regulations and related policies. Metro typically completes its distributed
forecast within one to two years after adopting the regional forecast in the UGR. Once
available, the distributed forecast will be substituted in place of housing capacity when
determining subsequent housing need allocations within the Metro UGB.

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Figure 9. Distribution by Component of Need for OHNA Metro Region, 2025

Step B: Allocation of Need from UGBs to Cities and Urban Unincorporated Lands (UULs)
As noted on page 20, House Bill 2889 (2023) maintains Metro’s statutory responsibility to
estimate the region’s housing need within the Metro UGB, while giving DAS the responsibility to
allocate that need to Metro cities and urban, unincorporated lands (UULs).
The allocation of future and current housing need to the cities and UULs within the OHNA
Metro Region but outside the Metro UGB (the blue areas in Figure 8 on page 20) mirrors the
methodology used in all other OHNA regions of the state.
The allocation of future and current housing need to cities and UULs within the Metro UGB
uses a different allocation methodology that is unique to the Metro UGB. This approach
reflects the fact that the area inside the Metro UGB functions as a single housing market with
many different jurisdictions; the Metro UGB also has access to more robust data that allows
for more nuanced indicators. Unique elements of the allocation methodology for the Metro
UGB include a more refined approach to capturing access to jobs, and an approach that takes
existing housing affordability and recent housing production into consideration when
allocating existing, unmet housing needs. Each component of the methodology is allocated
using the following indicators and weights:
Units Needed for Underproduction and for People Experiencing Homelessness:
• Production: 50% from the city’s rate of housing unit production relative to the UGB-wide
average as calculated from the Regional Land Information System (RLIS) parcel-based
housing layer, which provides unit counts and year built for parcels. Units built within
the last five years of the model “run-year” (the year corresponding to the model’s PUMS
22

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology

•

data inputs) are calculated as a share of total units within each jurisdiction and UUL
(Inverse weight – see comments on Inverse Weighting on page 27).
Affordability: 50% from the percentage of a city’s housing units that are rental 0-50%
AMI units, relative to the UGB-wide average, using the most recent vintage of the CHAS
5-year data (Inverse weight). Urban unincorporated lands within the UGB have their
affordability level calculated using tract-level CHAS data for tracts with at least 30% of
their area in the UUL. CHAS is more out-of-date compared to the ACS/PUMS products,
so the model corrects for this by applying the affordability rate from CHAS to the more
recent unit counts calculated with RLIS’s Housing Layer.

Future need is allocated to cities (including the unincorporated urbanizable areas for which
they have planning authority based on intergovernmental agreements) and UULs using the
following indicators and weights:
Units Needed to Accommodate Population Growth:
• Residential capacity: 33% from the city’s share of jurisdictional residential capacity, as
calculated with Metro’s UGR process, wherein capacity in Metro’s unincorporated
urbanizable areas has been assigned to their future responsible jurisdictions as shown
in Figure 10.10
• Jobs access: 33% from the city's share of UGB employed residents who live within
areas with adequate transit or walking access to jobs, as calculated with TriMet and
SMART's most recent transit schedule data and OpenStreetMap street grid data (see
comments on Measuring Jobs Access on page 25)
• Forecasted job growth: 33% from the city's share of all forecasted jobs to be added
between 2020 and 2050, based on Metro's UGR modeling. This metric uses Metro's
TAZ-level job forecasts, which are then assigned to cities using a Metro-provided map
of expected future jurisdictional responsibilities (see Figure 11 on page 26).

10

The allocation is required to incorporate population forecasts under ORS 195.033 and 195.036. Under these
statutes, only Metro is authorized to create population projections for cities within the Metro UGB for use in
comprehensive planning. Because Metro's distributed forecast won't be published until 2025 and given the
relatively close statistical relationship between modeled residential capacity and expected population growth,
residential capacity is used as a proxy for the forecast in the initial run of the methodology. In the future, once
Metro's distributed forecast is adopted, it will be substituted in as the source for this component of the allocation.

23

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Figure 10. Future Metro UGB Jurisdictional Responsibility

Units needed to accommodate demographic change:
• Current population: 33% from the city's share of current (baseline) population, as
calculated with 2020 block-level Decennial Census data. The choice to use Decennial
Census is driven by the need to allocate population to the complex UUL boundaries as
well as cities, which can only be done with granular geographies like census blocks
• Jobs access: 33% from the city's share of UGB employed residents who live within
areas with adequate transit or walking access to jobs, as calculated with TriMet and
SMART's most recent transit schedule data and OpenStreetMap street grid data (see
below).
• Residential capacity: 33% from the city's share of jurisdictional residential capacity, as
calculated with Metro's UGR process, wherein capacity in Metro's unincorporated
urbanizable areas has been assigned to their future responsible jurisdictions.
Units lost to second and vacation homes:
• Second and vacation homes: 100% from the city's share of all current UGB second and
vacation homes as calculated with 2020 Decennial Census place-level counts
24

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Measuring Jobs Access
One of the weights used to allocate units for population growth to Metro cities is a
measurement of transit access to jobs. The approach uses current TriMet and SMART’s
schedule data, OpenStreetMap street grid data, and open-source trip-routing software to plot
transit and walking trips from every Transit Analysis Zone (TAZ) in the Metro UGB to every
other TAZ in the Metro UGB.
Walk and transit access was chosen specifically to be most applicable to all households,
regardless of income and access to private vehicles as a mode of transportation. Joining this
with Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) job location data spatially allocated
to the TAZs, the model calculates the number of jobs reachable by transit within a 60-minute
journey, mid-week, at 8:00 AM. The UGBs’ TAZs are rank ordered by job access, and a
threshold is set at the 10th percentile to denote “transit access” zones. Each TAZ is assigned to
a city based on Metro’s TAZ planning jurisdiction shapefile, and where this information is
missing, it is assigned based on which city has the largest overlap with any given TAZ. The
number of employed residents living in these “transit access TAZs” is calculated for each
jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction’s share of the UGB’s total is used as the final weight.
In the interest of maintaining accurate assessments of transit access, future iterations of the
OHNA model will incorporate the most up-to-date TAZ-level jobs totals, transit schedules, and
OpenStreetMap data.
Measuring Job Growth
Similar to the transit allocation component, the methodology incorporates forecasted job
growth to operationalize the statutory direction to incorporate access/proximity to jobs as part
of the allocation. This component has the effect of allocating more housing where future job
growth is projected to occur. This data set is provided by Metro from their housing and
transportation modeling processes, based on TAZ geographies, with job total forecasts for
2020 and 2050 included in separate columns for each TAZ. TAZs are joined spatially to
jurisdictional boundaries (including planning agreements), based on spatial data provided by
Metro and the change in jobs between 2020 and 2050 is totaled for all Metro jurisdictions. The
weight is calculated as a jurisdiction’s share of all UGB added jobs.

25

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Figure 11. TAZ Transit Access Zones Used to Calculate the Jobs Access Weights

26

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Inverse Weighting
Several weights used in the Metro UGB Suballocation Methodology are termed “inverse
weights.” The selected inverse weights operationalize statutory direction for the allocation to
incorporate an "equitable distribution of housing" under ORS 184.453 (3)(c), ensuring cities
that have historically underproduced market-rate or affordable housing are responsible for a
greater proportionate share of housing underproduction. The selected inverse weights have
the effect of allocating more housing, particularly housing affordable at lower incomes, to
cities that have historically produced less market-rate and affordable housing units. The
inverse weighting system works in the following manner, using the “Production” weight as an
example:
•

•
•
•

Each city’s rate of housing unit production is calculated by taking the previous five years
of total permits from RLIS housing unit data and converting them to a percentage of
current total units.
The UGB average is calculated from among all cities.
The “delta,” or nominal units needed for each city to match the UGB’s average rate, is
calculated. Cities above the UGB average receive a weight of 0.
All the nominal deltas are converted to percent of the total delta. This percentage
becomes half the weight used to allocate underproduction and units needed to
accommodate homelessness.

Example Delta Calculation for Inverse Weights
UGB average rate of housing unit production: 7% of current units (average of all cities)
City X
City Y
City X’s current units: 12,000
City X’s actual production: 600
City X’s production rate: 5% of current units

City Y’s current units: 15,000
City Y’s actual production: 1,500
City Y’s production rate: 10% of current units

To match the UGB rate of housing
production, City X should have built 840 units
(7% * 12,000)

To match the UGB rate of housing
production, City Y only needed to build 1,050
units (7% * 15,000)

Its delta is 240 units (840 – 600)

Since it produced more than the average, it
has no delta, and its weight would be zero.

If the sum of all cities’ deltas was 500, City X
would have 240/500 or 48%. Because recent
production is only half of the weight for the
current need allocation, this 48% would be
averaged with the weight calculated for
affordability to arrive at a blended weight.

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Statewide and Regional Results
This section provides statewide and regional results of the total 20-year housing need by
income and need component along with the annual 2026 production target. Local city-level
results are provided by income level in Appendix A. The federal government shutdown in
October and November delayed the release of many of the foundational data sources used in
the methodology. Ultimately all of the sources of federal data that have regular annual data
updates were released in time for use in this year’s update.
The delay of the data release did however impact some components of the estimate of
housing need. The homelessness methodology and source data used in the methodology are
produced by Portland State University’s Homelessness Research and Action Collaborative
(HRAC). Data sources used by HRAC were not available in time to allow for an annual update
to the homelessness data. Therefore there is not an update for this component of need, and
the 2025 vintage was used for the 2026 production targets and 20-year estimate of need.
Other data used in the methodology are updated infrequently and are therefore either lagged
until a more recent vintage is available, or operate with predictable and known data update
cycles.
The population forecasts used in the methodology to inform the population growth and
demographic change components are produced by Portland State University’s Population
Research Center (PRC). PRC produces an annual update to their statewide population forecast,
but the update only covers a portion of the state. PRC divides the state into four regions, and
then annually produces an update for only one of the four regions (note that PRC regions do
not align with the OHNA regions). Each of the PRC regions is then updated on a four-year cycle,
in 2024 the Metro region was updated, and in 2025 the Willamette Valley was updated.
The Metro region was only partially updated in this year’s methodology, as the Metro UGB
calculation of need is statutorily conducted by Metro. Metro currently updates their growth
estimates every 6 years as part of the Urban Growth Report process. That process was most
recently completed in 2024 and used as part of the 2025 calculation of 20 years of need and
annual production target. All other parts of the Metro region were updated except for the
Metro UGB which is unchanged in the calculation of the total units of need. Local allocation is
updated for the entirety of the state on an annual basis. See the following section of the report
for a more complete description of all of the data sources and their update schedules.
The 2026 20-year calculation of total need is the average of the 2023, 2024, and 2025 annual
calculations of need, which rely primarily on census data that are lagged by a year. For
example, the 2025 annual calculation of need uses 2024 census data as the basis for its
calculation. The annual production target is the combination of a 20-year time horizon for
future need, and a 10-year time horizon for current need. The following charts and tables show
the state components of need for each of the 3 years used to create the 2026 20-year total
need, along with the statewide and regional annual regional targets by income level.

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
The 2026 statewide calculation of 20-years of need is 491,347 units, down from 494,502 units
in 2025. This translates to a 2026 statewide annual production target of 29,359 units, down
from 29,522 units in 2025.

Oregon Housing Needs Analysis 2026 Production Targets and Adopted Methodology
Appendix B. Alternative Counterfactual Metro Region Modeling
Alternative Scenario of Metro UGB Housing Needs with Counterfactual Standard OHNA
methodology applied to the Metro Region
As noted on page 20, House Bill 2889 (2023) retains Metro’s statutory responsibility to
estimate housing need within the Metro UGB. Metro has discretion on the data sources and
specific methods used in the UGR to estimate housing need, but the policy intent is for the
UGR methodology to align with OHNA methodology.
Metro updates its UGR every 6-years, with 2024 being the most recent update year. Metro
began the update process in early 2024 and adopted the UGR on December 5, 2024. Due to
timeline discontinuity between the OHNA methodology development process and Metro’s
process, the underlying methods and data sources used to estimate housing need within the
Metro UGB differ from OHNA. This discontinuity primarily affects the estimate of regional
housing need but also has some feedback loops into local allocation process. This
discontinuity could be reconciled if Metro were to update its UGR methodology to align with
the OHNA and/or produce an updated calculation of need on or before the 6-year update
schedule.
Differences Between Standard Methodology and Counterfactual applied to Metro region
A comparison is shown below demonstrating the difference in the estimate of total OHNA
Metro Region housing need had Metro’s UGR incorporated the OHNA methodology and
sources is provided below for reference use only. The standard OHNA approach is not part of
the statutory methodology, and included only to provide some guidance to assist in future
planning. A summary discussion of the major differences between methods is also included
below.
Had Metro’s UGR estimate of regional housing need incorporated the OHNA Methodology for
the calculation of total need, the estimate for the Metro UGB (a subset of the Metro Region)
would have been 198,300 compared to the statutory estimate of 178,100, a difference of
20,200 units.
The two largest differences between the OHNA Methodology and the Metro UGR methodology
are in how to estimate Underproduction, and how to estimate Units Needed for People
Experiencing Homelessness. Given the income distributions of these two components, the
majority of the difference between the two methods is contained within the 0-80% AMI
household income range.

Appendix C. Common Terms & Acronyms
AMI: Area Median Income: Every year the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) produces a median family income calculation/assessment to determine affordability
thresholds for a given area (some geographies are HUD-specific). Affordable housing projects’
income limits, rent limits, and other characteristics will be based on this income limit. This
term is synonymous with Median Family Income or MFI.11
City: This report uses the terms “City” and “city with a population of 10,000 or greater” as
DLCD does, which includes, regardless of size: (a) Any city within Tillamook County and the
communities of Barview/Twin Rocks/Watseco, Cloverdale, Hebo, Neahkahnie, Neskowin,
Netarts, Oceanside and Pacific City/Woods; and (b) A county with respect to its jurisdiction
over Metro urban unincorporated lands.
Cost Burdening / Severe Cost Burdening: The term “cost burdening” refers to households who
pay more than 30% of their income on housing costs. The term “severe cost burdening” is used
for households paying more than 50% of their income on housing. These terms come from
HUD, and include mortgage payments and interest, or rent, utilities, and insurance.
DAS: Department of Administrative Services
DLCD: Department of Land Conservation and Development
Goal 10 (Housing): One of Oregon’s 19 statewide land use planning requirements relating to
planning for housing need. All local governments are required to plan for housing needs within
an urban growth boundary (see term below) under Goal 10. Cities with populations larger than
10,000 people (as well as all cities and certain urban, unincorporated communities in
Tillamook County, and counties with urban unincorporated lands in the Metro area) must
regularly update local planning documents to comply with Goal 10.
Goal 14 (Urbanization): One of Oregon’s 19 statewide land use planning requirements relating
to planning for the orderly and efficient urbanization of land within an urban growth boundary
(UGB - see term below). All cities and Metro are required to establish and amend urban growth
boundaries to accommodate identified land needs in compliance with Goal 14.

A note on AMI vs MFI from HUD: “HUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan
area and non-metropolitan county. The metropolitan area definitions are the same ones HUD uses for Fair Market
Rents (except where statute requires a different configuration). HUD calculates Income Limits as a function of the
area's Median Family Income (MFI). The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the American
Community Survey, table B19113 - MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. The term Area Median
Income is the term used more generally in the industry. If the term Area Median Income (AMI) is used in an
unqualified manor, this reference is synonymous with HUD's MFI. However, if the term AMI is qualified in some
way - generally percentages of AMI, or AMI adjusted for family size, then this is a reference to HUD's income
limits, which are calculated as percentages of median incomes and include adjustments for families of different
sizes.” Source: HUD. 2018. “FY 2018 Income Limits Frequently Asked Questions.”

HB: House Bill (year)
Housing Affordability: Housing is considered “affordable” to a household if it spends less than
30% of its gross (pre-tax) income on housing costs (see Cost Burdening).
HSC: Housing Stability Council: The advisory body overseeing Oregon Housing and
Community Services.
HUD: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
LCDC: Land Conservation and Development Commission: The governing body with policy and
administrative oversight of the state land-use planning program. LCDC is supported by the
Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development.
Metro UGB: Metro Urban Growth Boundary: The Portland metropolitan area’s urban growth
boundary (UGB), managed by Metro. Within the Metro UGB, cities and counties do not have
individual UGBs. Since 1997, Oregon law also requires Metro to maintain a 20-year supply of
land for future residential development inside the Metro UGB. See also: UGB.
OEA: Oregon Office of Economic Analysis
OHNA: Oregon Housing Needs Analysis
OHCS: Oregon Housing and Community Services
PRC: Population Research Center
PUMA: Public Use Microdata Area: A geographic area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau to
have roughly 100,000 people and to (typically) align with County boundaries. PUMA sizes vary
depending on the population density. Oregon has 31 PUMAs, with most PUMAs located in the
more densely populated western part of the state.
PUMS: Public Use Microdata Sample: Data files produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that
allow users to create custom analyses that are not available through pre-tabulated data tables.
These data are produced for PUMA geographies.
Regulated Affordable Housing: Housing that is rent- or income-restricted to be affordable to
households earning certain incomes. These units typically have public support (funding) in
exchange for affordability requirements. Housing is considered “affordable” to a household if it
spends less than 30% of its gross (pre-tax) income on housing costs (see Cost Burdening
above). Regulations are set according to the types of funding used to develop the housing,
such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
funding. Most regulated affordable housing is affordable for households earning under 60%
AMI, but restrictions vary.
SB: Senate Bill (year)

UUL: Urban Unincorporated Lands: follows the definition in HB4063 (2024), which are lands
within the Metro urban growth boundary that are identified by the county as: (a) Not within a
city; (b) Zoned for urban development; (c) Within the boundaries of a sanitary district or
sanitary authority or a district formed for the purposes of sewage works; (d) Within the service
boundaries of a water provider with a water system; and (e) Not zoned with a designation that
maintains the land’s potential for future urbanization.
UGB: Urban Growth Boundary: A boundary delineating urban and urbanizable land from rural
land. This boundary contains urban development, is used to plan for orderly growth, and can be
amended to accommodate an identified land need. Cities in Oregon are surrounded by urban
growth boundaries (UGBs) which designate where they expect to grow over a 20-year period.
The Portland metropolitan region has a single regional UGB, established and maintained by
Metro. See also: Metro UGB.
