GLOSSARY

Acknowledgments
The authors of this report would like to express deep
appreciation to Nick Chun, Madeline Miller, and Justin
Sherrill at ECOnorthwest for their important technical
contributions and coaching sessions that helped us
discover many of the irritations and insights that
keep this work fun. We want to thank our CEO, Mike
Kingsella, and Up for Growth team members Kecia
Easley and Sara Gibson for supporting our ever-important
member network. We are equally indebted to our team of
consultants and contractors, including Erin Doyle, Lance
Hayden, Mary Louise Randolph, and Sherri Reed.
Finally, we acknowledge Up for Growth’s Board of
Directors and Advisory Council, whose leadership propels
our mission to forge policies and partnerships to achieve
housing equity, eliminate systemic barriers, and create
more homes.

The Message
is Clear
80% of residents in rural areas and 72% in urban areas believe
housing affordability is getting worse in their communities.
This view is prevalent among renters and homeowners across all
demographics: political party identification, education, race, age,
and gender.
74% of suburban residents and 76% of rural residents agree that
“America has a housing shortage, and we need more homes and
rentals.”

Confronting the Crisis:
Addressing America’s Housing
Supply Challenge Together
For most people, the moment they step
into their first home is a memory that
lingers for a lifetime. It’s a feeling of
fulfillment, a sense of safety and security,
and a tangible realization of the American
Dream. For generations, homeownership
has been a cornerstone of this dream,
representing a better life for oneself
and one’s family. What’s more, housing
determines your access to health care,
the schools your children attend, and the
economic opportunities afforded to you.
I was a first grader when my parents
moved us out of public housing into our
childhood home. That day remains etched
in my memory, a constant reminder of the
opportunities homeownership provided
my family.

Yet, there are still too many children
who haven’t experienced this sense of
refuge. The housing supply crisis in the
United States has reached critical levels,
significantly contributing to widespread
housing insecurity and economic
instability for Americans. This scarcity
has the potential to create a domino
effect, leading to housing inflation,
competitive rental markets, increased
pressure on landlords, and, ultimately, a
rise in evictions, which can contribute to
an increase in homelessness.
This report by Up for Growth on the
underproduction of housing supply
should be considered a call to action. As
champions and advocates, Up for Growth
continues to raise awareness of the
necessary steps we need to take to finally

shore up our nation’s depleted housing
stock.
My work in Congress on this issue
has been driven by both personal
and professional motivations. Every
American deserves the dignity of living
in a safe, affordable home. This is not
just a utopian ideal but a fundamental
right that touches all aspects of our
lives. Affordable home ownership builds
generational wealth and provides a stable
foundation for economic mobility. That is
why I am calling on all of my colleagues
to recognize the severity of the current
supply and affordability crisis in our
country.
We face a nationwide shortage of 3.85
million homes, with my home state

of Delaware alone missing more than
12,000 homes. This critical undersupply
disproportionately impacts low-income
renters and families of color who have
been historically denied access and
capital to housing in areas of opportunity.
We must act boldly to address this crisis.
If we do not, generations of families will
continue to be burdened by the inability
to obtain a basic privilege: a safe place to
call home.

the Pathways to Removing Obstacles to
Housing (PRO Housing) grant program,
which has been funded through past
appropriations in Congress.

My commitment to this issue stems
from my previous roles in Delaware,
including Secretary of Labor, Deputy
Secretary of Health and Social Services,
and CEO of the Urban League, where
I chaired the Delaware Housing
Roundtable. I witnessed firsthand the
interconnectedness of health, housing,
and economic opportunity.

I am excited to build upon this work with
the Reducing Regulatory Barriers to
Housing Act, which I introduced this past
summer with Senator John Fetterman
(D-PA). This bill is supported by over 130
local and national organizations and aims
to provide resources, data, and models to
help state and local governments reform
outdated regulations. By digitizing zoning
codes and investing in housing in lowerincome and rural areas, we can diversify
housing inventories, end discriminatory
practices, increase workforce housing,
and improve housing affordability across
the nation.

In 2021, I introduced the Housing
Supply and Affordability Act, which
aims to increase housing availability by
empowering states, local governments,
Native American Tribes, and
municipalities to develop comprehensive
housing plans. These plans will help
address the shortage of affordable
housing and mitigate rising living costs.
Additionally, the bill encourages local
governments to eliminate exclusionary
zoning and discriminatory land use
policies. I am so proud of how this
landmark legislation was the catalyst for

While this is a significant step, our
housing challenges are deeply rooted in
historical and systemic issues. We must
not only address these problems but also
reimagine outdated housing regulations
that have contributed to the current
crisis.

Addressing the housing supply crisis
requires a long-term commitment from
the federal government. But it also
demands that advocates like Up for
Growth—working tirelessly to address
our housing inventory challenges and
to reverse bad policies—hold bad actors
accountable for their role in this crisis

and bring affordable housing access back
within reach.
Without concerted effort, the shortage
will continue to exacerbate inequalities
and hinder economic progress. I’m
proud to support Up for Growth’s bold,
unafraid work to dismantle exclusionary
and discriminatory zoning policies.
Through their efforts and a bipartisan
coalition in Congress, we can create more
equitable, affordable, and climate-resilient
communities. By taking decisive action,
we can work toward a future where every
American has access to safe, affordable,
and stable housing, ensuring that every
family is one step closer to living their
American Dream.

Building for Tomorrow: How
Supply-Focused Solutions Can
Address Rising Housing Costs
An Essay by Representative
Mike Flood
(R-NE-01)
In this country, homeownership carries
the promise of stability and upward
mobility. But in recent years, high
inflation and a housing shortage have
combined to make homeownership
unreachable for many Nebraskans. Since
2019, the average cost to buy a home in
Madison County, where I live with my
family, has increased by 70%, pushing the
price of homeownership to record highs.
Inflation and housing undersupply are a
one-two punch that makes it increasingly
difficult for Nebraskans to save up and
buy a home.
Madison County is full of hard-working,
close-knit communities with jobs in
manufacturing, the meatpacking and
agricultural industries, and other sectors.
They take pride in their heritage and way
of life. But today in Madison County, the
average worker earns about $24,000 per
year below what’s required to comfortably
purchase a home.
Sadly, this phenomenon isn’t unique to
Madison County. I travel across the state
talking to local leaders and business
owners whose stories echo the same
familiar tale: high housing costs are
forcing families to move further and
further away in search of more affordable
housing options. Unable to find and
hire skilled workers, local businesses
face labor shortages that increase
costs, decrease productivity, and reduce
revenue. Over time, this phenomenon
becomes a drag on growth for small
communities across the country. Today’s
housing crisis goes beyond where people
live; it’s about whether our communities
can grow and prosper. If Madison County
and places like it across the state are
going to thrive, we must address this
crisis head-on.

6

While state and local governments
rightly control many of the drivers that
affect housing supply, such as zoning and
land use laws, building regulations, and
incentives for private development, my
colleagues and I are working to uncover
ways the federal government can support
state and local efforts to increase housing
supply and stabilize communities. A
prime example is the Yes in My Backyard
Act (HR 3507), which I am honored
to co-lead alongside my colleagues
Congressman Derek Kilmer (D-WA) and
Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Todd
Young (R-IN). Passing the YIMBY Act is
a meaningful first step, but there is room
for more.
By fostering innovation in manufactured
and modular housing, we can provide
more affordable starter homes for families
and spur important manufacturing and
supply chain growth. Additionally, we
can support localities in their efforts
to cut red tape and eliminate onerous
regulations that make it expensive and
inefficient to build new homes.
Up for Growth has been a valuable
partner in this effort. Their
Underproduction Report helps
policymakers better understand the scale
and effects of the housing shortage, and
it’s my hope that their work will help push
Congress toward bipartisan solutions on
housing supply.
I remain committed to working with
my colleagues in Washington and
industry leaders across Nebraska to find
solutions that will help Madison County
and communities everywhere expand
homeownership opportunities and create
housing choice for all hardworking
Americans.

In 2021, low interest rates and increased demand due to new household formation during
the pandemic resulted in a 15-year high for new home permits issued. Over the period
from 2021 to 2022, housing unit completions increased by 3.3%. The 50,000 unit decrease
in housing underproduction over the same period resulted from increased housing
production and the continuation of pandemic-related migration patterns as people
adjusted to a new hybrid work environment.

For the first time since we began measuring housing underproduction in 2012, the gap
between the housing we have and the housing we need narrowed, moving from 3.89 to
3.85 million. While the total number of missing units decreased, a regional look at the
improvement suggests larger dynamics may be at play. This report looks into the root causes
of the housing shortage plaguing the country, exploring regional trends of improvement in
the West, and worsening underproduction in the middle of country.

Underproduction is present in all 50
states and the District of Columbia. It
is present in urban, suburban, and rural
areas.
There are national and regional
dynamics at play.
Underproduction decreased in 26 states
and 28 of the top 50 underproduced

improvements occurred yields clues about
how and where the crisis is spreading.
Housing production hasn’t kept pace

Relying on Census data from 2022, this report covers a period when the economy was still
experiencing the lingering effects of the pandemic. Though it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when
the “pandemic era” ends, there are signs that some of the trends associated with the pandemic have
stabilized. While this report presents a snapshot of the past, comparing it to observed outcomes
today yields new insights into the nature, maturity, and future of the national housing crisis.

Drivers and
Trends
What to Expect in
this Report

During the COVID-19 era, household formation patterns and
workplace norms shifted more dramatically than they had since
the early 20th century. The pandemic accelerated household
formation, as individuals, especially young adults, moved out
of shared living arrangements or family homes to create their
own spaces. The shift to remote work enabled people to move
further away from urban centers, which were traditionally tied
to job locations. Combined, these trends led to increased demand
for homes everywhere, particularly in the suburbs, exurbs, and

rural areas, driving up prices and putting a strain on already low
housing inventory in these regions.
By 2021, the surge in household growth among millennials had
recovered nearly all ground lost during the Great Recession,
and overall household formation returned to levels not seen
since 2011. Projections through 2028 suggest a return to more
moderate household formation rates (Joint Center for Housing
Studies, 2024).

America’s housing supply has leapt into the national spotlight.
Presidential candidates from both major parties have included
housing plans in their platforms and featured the housing crisis
as a talking point in major speeches. Bipartisan housing bills
are moving through state legislatures and the U.S. Senate and
House of Representatives. Housing underproduction and the
severe consequences of the supply shortage have officially gone
mainstream.
But, if housing underproduction has decreased, is the
housing shortage really such a problem? Is the worst part
over? Can the country move on from it?
In the following pages, we examine how the year-over-year
decrease in housing underproduction belies the escalating
urgency of the national housing shortage and why we have reason
to expect that some of the most difficult challenges lie ahead.
In an examination of five metro areas, we explore the nuance
of changing housing market dynamics around the county. In
doing so, we also uncover how the effects of regional shortages
can manifest in other parts of the country. We go on to explore
12

how different regions are approaching solutions, some yielding
promising results and others struggling to meet the scale of the
need. The report concludes with examples of local, state, and
federal interventions that effectively reduce the housing supply
shortage.

With millions of missing homes, monitoring and reporting on
year-over-year changes can seem trivial. But in doing so, we are
reminded annually to reflect not on missing units but instead on
the millions of people who cannot find a home simply because
there aren’t enough of them to go around.

1200

The deterioration of our culture, economy, businesses, and
communities due to the housing shortage is preventable, but
doing so will require short-term interventions and coordinated
long-term strategies at all levels of government. We hope this
report will encourage meaningful action to curb the national
housing shortage so that every person—regardless of income or
background—can achieve the dream of a home in a community
they choose.

high level of growth is not expected to continue, with household formation rates expected to return to more typical levels of around 1.2

Hybrid work has become more common, with most remoteeligible employees working from the office two to three days
a week. In-office foot traffic initially plummeted due to the
pandemic but recovered steadily from 2020 to 2022 and
stabilized by January 2023.
Though there is speculation of wide regional variation in return
to office (RTO) rates, data on badge swipes from Kastle Systems,
a global managed security company, suggests this range is fairly
narrow. The lowest RTO locations have rates only 10% lower than
the national average, and the places with the highest RTO rates
exceed the national average by about 10%.

Proceed with Caution
While underproduction remained flat between
2021 and 2022, 3.85 million missing homes is
a staggering shortfall. Though some metros
have narrowed the gap, there is reason to be
wary that such progress will continue.
The U.S. produced more single-detached
homes in 2022 than in any of the 15 previous
years, and new apartment construction
reached its highest level since 1987. Yet, new
housing starts began to decline in 2023 and
continue to fall in most metro areas due to
high interest rates and construction costs
(Henderson, 2024). Because this report is
limited to data through 2022, these numbers
do not reflect the looming “permit cliff”
threatening to derail progress.

low in the data series, suggesting that
completions are outpacing starts by an
unprecedented margin.

Case Studies
of Metropolitan
Areas
Charting annual underproduction numbers allows us to see
and analyze the complexities of local markets. Sometimes,
what the past reveals can help prepare us for what to
expect in the future. With that in mind, this section focuses
on five metro areas, each experiencing various stages and
degrees of housing underproduction.

What we discover is that decreases in housing
underproduction are sometimes, but not always, the
result of the market responding to well-calibrated policies.
Occasionally, they reveal how local policies and market
conditions lead to worsening housing affordability and
availability.

For each metro, we examine trends in housing
underproduction, population growth rates, overall housing
unit production, and housing unit production relative to
new household formation.

In this section, we explore why declining housing
underproduction in San Francisco may be a bellwether
for metros like Houston and Nashville. We also examine
metros that, by being proactive, are mitigating the worst
effects of the housing shortage.

Peak delivery of multifamily
homes occurred in 2024, about
2 years after the peak of permit
cycle. Beginning in 2025 and
continuing for at least one
year, multifamily unit delivery
is expected to steeply decline.
This trend, if sustained, will
have significant implications
for housing supply and market
dynamics in the multifamily
sector moving forward.

Permits

Fluctuations in the housing market over time show the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent recovery.
However, after the peak in Q3 2022, there seems to be a downturn in new housing permits, indicating possible market contraction
or a slowdown in new construction (U.S. Census Bureau & U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).

On the surface, the Bay Area showed the
most improvement between 2021 and 2022
of any metro area, narrowing its housing
underproduction gap by 15,268 homes. However,
this apparent progress is more emblematic of a
broken housing system, rather than one that has
diagnosed and remedied the problem.
The region’s improvement wasn’t due to
increased homebuilding: the Bay Area built
just 0.60 new homes for every household
formed during this period. Instead, the decline
in underproduction is due to a sharp decrease
in demand, as many residents left the area
altogether. This is reflected in the year-overyear change in population and the decrease in
household formation overall.
The region’s notoriously difficult development
environment remains a major obstacle. High
development costs, exclusionary zoning
practices, geographic limitations, and resistance
from litigious housing opponents continue to
stifle the necessary growth to address the region’s
housing shortage. Even with the reduction in
underproduction, the Bay Area still faced a
shortfall of over 51,000 homes. As a result, many
households that would have formed locally were
priced out and settled elsewhere, likely aided
by remote work policies that allowed them to
relocate to more affordable areas. In 2022 alone,
the Bay Area experienced a net loss of 68,000
residents (Bay Area Council Economic Institute,
2019).

The San Francisco Bay Area is often seen as
the epicenter of the nation’s housing supply

economic growth and desirable living conditions
have combined with inadequate housing
production to create dire housing conditions,
especially for individuals and families earning

While the year-over-year trends are concerning,
there are glimmers of hope for the future. Several
cities in the Bay Area have recently implemented
reforms to increase housing production, some
of which have been spurred by state-level
legislation. San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, and
Emeryville received “pro-housing” designations
from the California Department of Housing and
Community Development for their efforts to
improve housing policies (California Department
of Housing and Community Development,
n.d.; City of San Francisco, 2024). Additionally,
California’s reformation of its Housing Element
and Regional Housing Needs Allocation laws,
combined with stronger enforcement from state
agencies, may push Bay Area localities to plan for
and approve more housing developments moving
forward.
Though the Bay Area remains a challenging
market for housing production, these recent
policy changes offer some optimism for a region
grappling with long-standing underproduction
and affordability challenges.

The Takeaway
Improved year-over-year underproduction numbers in a subset of
metros are not due to a purposeful acceleration of housing supply to
match growing demand. Instead, household formation in these areas
significantly decreased. Driven in no small part by the high cost of
housing, households that could have formed in these communities
formed somewhere else instead. This phenomenon, as observed in the
San Francisco Bay area, could explain why the middle of the country
shows worsening underproduction while the West shows overall
improvement.

Greater Houston
Area

Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land, TX

Metro Type
Underproduced metro with worsening
housing underproduction due to
inadequate home production relative to
household formation.

Houston has long been considered a
development-friendly metro, successfully
keeping housing costs relatively low through
more permissive land use policies (Staveski
& Horozitz, 2023). This approach, combined
with high rates of suburban expansion, helped
accommodate rapid population growth for
many years (Begley, 2021). Between 1997
and 2017, the Houston metro area grew by
63%. Their expansive development pattern
maintained broad affordability and has even
been credited with reducing the number of
people experiencing homelessness in the city
(Smiley & Hakkenberg, 2020; Ochoa, 2024).
However, the limits of expansive growth are
now becoming evident.

Despite producing nearly 66,000 housing units in
2022, Houston is not building enough to meet demand.
The metro region built only 0.83 units per every new
household formed, well below what was needed to
match population growth. As a result, housing costs are
rising. Median home prices in Harris County jumped
43% between 2018 and 2022, and Houston’s affordability
is eroding (Miller, 2024). In 2011, area median income
(AMI) was 217% higher than the amount needed to
purchase a median-priced home, but by 2023, AMI
was only 13% higher, signaling that homeownership is
increasingly out of reach for many residents (Hegar,
2024). The city’s supply of deeply affordable housing
remains particularly low, compounding the challenge
for households earning lower incomes (National Low
Income Housing Coalition, 2024).
The availability of land that once kept housing prices
down is no longer a sustainable solution. Expansive
growth has increased the strain on infrastructure, made
disaster preparedness more challenging, and raised
costs for maintaining essential services (Rafferty, 2019;
Vidal, 2017). Extreme weather events add further risks,
with Houston particularly vulnerable to hurricanes,
heat waves, and other natural disasters (Rojanasakul
& Popovich, 2024). As the metro area spreads further
from its core, the inefficiencies of expansive growth are
becoming clear, contributing to rising housing costs
despite the ongoing construction.

Houston’s historically permissive land use policies and
rapid suburban expansion helped keep housing affordable
for years, but the city’s growth model now appears to be
reaching its limits. Despite producing thousands of new
housing units, supply has not kept pace with demand,
leading to rising housing costs and eroding affordability.
Additionally, sprawling development has strained
infrastructure, increased disaster vulnerability, and added
long-term challenges to maintaining services.

Greater
Nashville Area

The Takeaway
Nashville has significantly increased housing production in recent
years, but new construction has primarily occurred outside the
urban core, failing to meet central area demand. Despite efforts to
adjust zoning policies and encourage growth, the city’s sprawling
development pattern has not improved affordability, with nearly half
of households being cost-burdened and homeownership increasingly
out of reach for families earning low and middle incomes.

Nashville has made significant strides in housing
production in recent years but has struggled to keep
pace with growing demand. In 2019, 15,368 homes were
completed, while in 2022, that number grew to 57,926.
During the same period, the metro population grew
from 1.26 million to 1.41 million, an 11.4% increase. The
Nashville-area homebuilding industry recognized the need
to build and responded by significantly increasing housing
supply. However, most new homes were developed outside
the urban core, failing to address the need for housing in
more desirable, central areas.
Case Study
22

The Nashville region, driven by a fiscally
conservative approach that reduces
regulatory barriers, has historically
been friendly to single-detached home
development. In the 1990s, the City
invested heavily in infrastructure,
adopting a “build it, and they will come”
philosophy and constructing amenities
like sports arenas, museums, and
libraries to attract development and
boost investment (Kelly, 2023a). More
recently, Nashville updated its zoning
policies to encourage growth in targeted
areas. In 2020, the City’s Urban Zoning
Overlay (UZO) eliminated parking
minimums along multimodal corridors
and in the downtown core (Shane, 2023).
Zoning changes also facilitated the rise

of Nashville’s unique “tall and skinny”
homes, which are made possible by state
laws, such as the Horizontal Property
Regime Act, and detached duplex rules
that allow two homes on a single lot
(Kelly, 2023b; Rochford Law, 2024).
Despite these efforts, Nashville still faces
significant challenges. The city is one of
the most sprawling metros in the country,
and this development pattern has not
improved affordability (Smart Growth
America, 2024). Nearly 47% of households
in the metro area are cost-burdened. As
of 2024, a Nashville household needs
an annual income of over $100,000 to
afford the median home price, effectively
excluding families earning low and middle
incomes from homeownership (Pena, 2024).

The metro’s success is not by chance. Two decades
ago, the region implemented Wasatch Choices
2040, a long-range land use and transportation
plan that laid the groundwork for smart, transitoriented growth (Szczepanski, 2011). The plan
established principles that prioritize significant
investments in transportation infrastructure to
foster thoughtful development. Salt Lake City
has tied a major expansion of its rail network to
policies promoting dense growth around station
areas, encouraging more compact and efficient
development patterns.
In addition to local efforts, the State of Utah has
played a proactive role in promoting housing
growth through statewide policy changes. The
state legislature recently passed bills that require
cities to allow accessory dwelling units (ADUs)
and that create uniform modular building codes
(State of Utah, 2021; State of Utah, 2024). Utah
lawmakers have also focused on developing new
financing tools to build critical infrastructure
and offering low-interest loans to developers who
commit to building affordable starter homes
(McKellar, 2024).

investments to encourage dense, efficient growth. The State of Utah
has also supported housing growth with policies and financing tools to

The Takeaway
The Raleigh-Cary region has successfully addressed housing demand
through proactive land use reforms, producing 4.34 homes for every
new household formed between 2019 and 2022. Zoning changes in
both Raleigh and Cary, particularly the allowance of missing middle
housing and ADUs, have significantly increased housing supply,
helping keep housing costs manageable and reducing the area’s
housing gap. The number of renters and homeowners in the region
experiencing cost-burdening is relatively low.

In recent years, the Raleigh-Cary region
in North Carolina has successfully
implemented a number of policies around
housing supply that have resulted in
homebuilding commensurate with
increasing demand. Experiencing a 4.6%
increase in new households between 2019
and 2022, the region produced enough
housing to accommodate this growth
and reduce its housing gap by over 5,000
homes. Raleigh-Cary built an impressive
4.34 homes for every new household
formed, a production rate that has
helped keep housing costs under control.
As a result, the number of households
experiencing cost-burdening remained
low in the area. Renters spent an average
of 27% of their income on rent, while
homeowners with a mortgage spent 18%.
Cities in the region have found success largely through
proactive land use reform. In 2021, the City of Raleigh
made fundamental zoning changes, allowing for
missing middle housing types—duplexes, triplexes,
and townhomes—through a by-right approval process
(Eanes, 2024). These changes are credited with enabling
the construction of 2,800 new homes, which account
for roughly 30% of all new housing built since 2021.
Meanwhile, the City of Cary has embraced similar
housing policies, passing a comprehensive plan in 2021
that laid the groundwork for zoning reforms. Among
other strategies, Cary expanded the use of ADUs,
further supporting the region’s efforts to increase
housing supply (Polk, 2021).

Though the timelines and strategies for expanding available
housing vary, each of these metros offers valuable lessons for
other areas confronting the housing supply crisis. To succeed
in meeting housing needs and achieving broader economic and
growth objectives, communities must understand the scope and
drivers of their own housing shortages, weigh the tradeoffs they
are willing to accept, and implement policies that bring their
growth objectives to life.
As we’ve seen in these case studies, metro areas across the
country are grappling with housing underproduction in varying

ways, with some cities making notable strides while others
continue to face mounting challenges. These local examples
highlight the impact proactive policies and reforms have on
housing supply, yet they also underscore that no single metro can
fully solve the housing crisis on its own.
To achieve lasting change and address the national housing
deficit, broader action is required. This is where essential federal,
state, and local interventions come into play—policies that
can remove barriers, modernize housing finance, and foster
innovation to ensure housing needs are met across the country.
27

Calls to Action
Despite positive signs that housing underproduction may be improving
in some parts of the country, the United States as a whole has a deficit of
3.85 million homes. With new housing starts stagnating due to high costs,
constrained capital markets, and the high cost of borrowing, it is important
to implement pro-housing policies at all levels to ensure that new home
building can be accelerated to meet critical needs.

Essential Federal Actions
The federal government plays a critical role in achieving
housing stability. It can act to remove itself as a barrier
to housing development. It can modernize and
reposition its financing tools and products to support
a new generation of builders and mitigate high
construction costs and risks. It can also catalyze
innovation in homebuilding. Together, these essential
actions can support needed housing production.

Remove Federal Barriers to
Housing Development
• Take administrative action to reduce or remove tariffs on
materials like softwood lumber that are commonly used
in home construction
• Expand the thoughtful disposition of federally owned
land for homebuilding
• Streamline or exempt some types of housing from
National Environmental Policy Act requirements
• Streamline and expedite federal funding applications
• Explore ways to improve building code requirements to
allow for more types of housing choices, e.g., standards
for single-staircase reform (to allow for more efficient
construction of smaller-scale buildings) or new
standards for mass timber building
• Align climate resiliency goals with housing production
strategies
28

Essential State and Local Actions
While the federal government has an essential role in addressing the housing supply and affordability challenge, the most
tangible policy reforms happen at the state and local levels. To this end, state and local policymakers can proactively enact
and implement pro-housing policies. While every municipality is different and every state has different needs, all fifty
states have a gap between the housing they have and the housing they need.

Modernize Housing Finance
Tools and Products
• Pass legislation to improve and expand the Low Income
Housing Tax Credit, the country’s primary means of funding
for the construction and preservation of affordable housing
• Examine and modernize existing loan products to apply to
a broader array of housing types and homebuilders, such as
smaller developers who will be the primary builders of smallerscale housing typologies like duplexes, townhomes, and other
missing middle housing types

Spur Innovation
• Catalyze novel homebuilding approaches that can potentially
lower the costs and time it takes to complete new projects,
e.g., supporting the growth of factory-built homes and other
emerging construction technologies and methods
• Develop innovative, sustainable, and resilient building
materials in areas of the country prone to flooding, wildfires, or
other natural disasters
• Invest in building and strengthening the construction
workforce

Remove Barriers to Housing
Development
• Update local zoning and land use codes to allow
housing typologies like duplexes and townhomes to
be built in more locations and with minimal or limited
discretionary review
• Relax height and setback requirements and eliminate
minimum parking standards to make building new
housing simpler and less expensive
• Revise state and local building codes to facilitate the
growth of smaller-scale housing projects and single-stair
development
• Shorten the community and planning review process
and provide a consistent and transparent timeline that
reduces approval and permitting delays
• Explore statewide legislation (see AZ, MT, MA, and OR)
to enable the development of less intensive housing
types like ADUs in most communities
• States can provide clear local growth expectations while
allowing communities substantial leeway to decide how
best to plan for and meet unique local needs.

Help
Projects Pencil
• Create and correctly calibrate incentive-based policies,
such as density bonuses or tax abatements, to ensure
they work effectively with market conditions
• Incentivize builders to convert unused properties or land
into housing (adaptive reuse)
• Use tax policy and other local incentives to encourage
infill and transit-oriented development

Create Financing
Opportunities for New
Projects
• Create new or partner with existing community land
banks and trusts to inventory and manage unused or
excess land
• Provide quick and accessible acquisition funding to
preserve and protect naturally occurring affordable
housing
• Create local sources for financing, such as revolving loan
funds for affordable housing, similar to Montgomery
County, MD; Chicago, IL; and Atlanta, GA

We Need
More
Housing
The U.S. housing crisis will not go away on its own. Although the
overall housing underproduction gap narrowed slightly between
2021 and 2022, not all progress was due to positive pro-housing
policies or trends. In many cases, a decline in demand, rather than
an increase in housing production, drove this change. As the case
studies show, individual metros like San Francisco and Houston
continue to grapple with affordability and strained infrastructure,
highlighting the pressing need for a more comprehensive and
coordinated approach to solving the housing shortage.
To meet the nation’s housing needs, action at the federal, state,
and local levels is necessary. Federal policies can modernize
housing finance tools, remove regulatory barriers, and spur

homebuilding innovation. State and local governments must
focus on land-use reforms, streamline approval processes,
and create targeted financial incentives to help alleviate
housing shortages in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
The U.S. housing market is at a crossroads. Without
sustained and proactive efforts, the 3.85 million-unit housing
deficit will continue to exacerbate economic inequality and
limit opportunities for millions of people. By implementing
forward-thinking housing policies and investing in
sustainable solutions, we can work to create an equitable
and accessible housing landscape for all.

Creating
2022 Custom
Geographies
Every decade, the U.S. Census Bureau alters Public Use
Microdata Area (PUMA) boundaries based on patterns
of demographic change from the previous decade. PUMA
boundaries are split in some cases, merged in others, and, in rare
cases, redrawn entirely. To maintain a longitudinally consistent
account of underproduction across the 2010s and 2020s for all
metro areas, Up for Growth engaged ECOnorthwest to create
custom 2020 vintage (v2020) PUMA-Metro geographies that are
comparable across the two decades. Details on this update can
be found on our website at https://upforgrowth.org/technicalmemo-for-v2020-u4g-geographies/

Glossary
Adaptive Reuse. The process of using an existing building for
a purpose different than it was initially built for.
ADU. An acronym for accessory dwelling unit, a self-contained
residential unit located on the same property as a primary
residential structure.
Area Median Income (AMI). Calculated on an annual basis
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
defined as the midpoint of a specified area’s income distribution,
with half the population earning above and half earning below the
amount.
Census Tract. A small statistical subdivision of a county with
an average population of 4,000 individuals. The primary purpose
of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for
the presentation and analysis of statistical data.
Community Land Bank or Trust. A nonprofit organization
that holds or manages land for a specific local community, acting
as a long-term steward for affordable housing, civic buildings,
commercial spaces, and other community resources.
Cost-Burdened. An individual or family that spends more
than 30% of their income on housing costs.
Density. The number of developed units in a specific area of
land. Residential density, for example, is typically measured by
dwelling units per acre (du/ac) or alternatively, as the ratio of
building footprint to the size of the site, known as Floor Area
Ratio (FAR).

Medium Density. Residential development that falls
between attached small-scale development (see Missing Middle
housing) and high-density development. Buildings are typically
constructed using wood framing and are two to four stories tall.

High Density. Residential development at the highest end of
the density distribution, typically with more than five stories and
constructed as podium or high-rise buildings.
High-Opportunity Neighborhoods. Places rich in jobs,
transportation, infrastructure, and community assets.
Housing Availability. Measurement of the change in the
shortage of housing units from one year to the next relative to
the total number of housing units available in the initial year.
This metric offers a nuanced understanding of housing scarcity
shifts over a given period and is useful for academic analysis and
policy-making.
Housing Underproduction. Occurs when communities
fall short of meeting housing needs. Up for Growth calculates
underproduction as the difference between total housing need
and total housing availability.
Infrastructure-Rich. Located either within one-half mile
of high-frequency transit station areas or within the top 20%
of walkable places based on data from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s National Walkability Index.
Insufficient Availability. A lack of housing adequate
to support a balanced housing market and absorb market
fluctuations and demand preferences.
Job-Rich. An area that has a minimum of two jobs per housing
unit.

Density Bonus. Offers development permissions beyond what
a zoning code allows to incentivize developers to contribute to
desired policy goals.

Local Control. The legal powers of local governments (e.g.,
cities and counties) to create regulations. Zoning codes and other
land use regulations are the most conspicuous and universal
forms of local control.

Exclusionary Zoning. A residential zoning plan in which
requirements (e.g., minimum lot and/or house size) have the
effect of excluding residents who earn lower incomes.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). Federal tax
credits allocated to state housing finance agencies and awarded
to developers to raise equity capital to build affordable housing.

Exurban. A semi-rural region lying just beyond the suburbs of
a city.

Mass Timber Building. A building approach that utilizes
engineered wood products to create large, structural elements
like beams, columns, and slabs. It differs from traditional stick
building by employing advanced techniques to form strong
structural elements that can support larger and more complex
designs.

Great Recession. A common term for the steep decline in
economic activity in the United States from December 2007 to
June 2009 and the global recession in 2009.

Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A geographic entity
delineated by the Office of Management and Budget for use by
federal statistical agencies. MSAs have at least one urbanized
area with a population of 50,000 or more and adjacent territory
that is socially and economically integrated with the core,
determined by examining commuting ties.
Micropolitan Statistical Area. A geographic entity
delineated by the Office of Management and Budget for use by
federal statistical agencies. Micropolitan Statistical Areas have
a population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 and include
adjacent territory that is socially and economically integrated
with the core, identified through commuting ties.

Rural. Nonmetropolitan counties that do not qualify as
micropolitan as designated by the National Center for Health
Statistics urban-rural classification scheme for counties.
Share of Household Formation. The proportion of new
households being created within a specific demographic group,
geographic area, or time frame as compared to the total number
of new households formed in the broader population.
Single-detached Housing. Housing that is a freestanding
residential building —one dwelling unit— usually occupied by
only one household or family. Mother-in-law or basement suites
may be allowed in some places without changing the description
from single-detached. Also known as single-family housing.
Suburban. A combination of Large Fringe metros and Medium
metros as designated by the National Center for Health Statistics
urban-rural classification scheme for counties.

Millennials. People in the demographic cohort known as
Generation Y or Gen Y, which is usually defined as those born
between around 1981 and 1996.

Suburbanization. A population shift of people and businesses
out of city centers into lower-density peripheral areas. It is often
associated with sprawl.

Missing Households. Households that may not have formed
due to lack of availability and affordability, e.g., households with
children over 18 years of age still living with their parents or
individuals or couples living together as roommates at levels
exceeding historical norms.

Target Vacancy Rate. Real estate markets are characterized
by frictions that tend to impede the process of market clearing.
In a frictionless economy, the requirement that supply equals
demand implies that vacancy rates should be zero. Housing
markets, in fact, are very decentralized, making it difficult at
times to match a particular home with the most appropriate
resident. Landlords want to lease to tenants who are most willing
to pay for their space and will set rents so that not all tenants will
find the lease attractive. Thus, even in equilibrium, we should
expect to observe some empty space.

Missing Middle Housing. Describes a range of multifamily
or clustered housing types compatible in scale with single-family
and transitional neighborhoods that is intended to meet demand
for walkable neighborhoods, respond to changing demographics,
and provide housing at different price points.
Modular Housing. A type of prefabricated home that is built
in a factory rather than on-site and is made up of large, threedimensional pieces known as modules.
Multifamily Housing. Housing in which multiple separate
housing units for residential inhabitants are contained in one
building or several buildings within one complex. Units can be
stacked on top of each other (top and bottom units) or next to
each other (side-by-side units). Common forms are apartment
buildings, cohousing projects, and condominiums, where,
typically, the units are owned by the occupants rather than leased
from a single building owner.
NIMBY. An acronym that stands for Not In My Back Yard, a
term most often used to depict opposition to individual real
estate developments or policies that would create more homes.
Parking Minimums or Mandates. Regulations that
require a certain number of off-street parking spaces per dwelling
unit or based on square footage, creating increased costs to
developers, potential homebuyers, and renters.

Uninhabitable Units. Housing units that have been vacant
for more than a year that do not contain a full functioning kitchen
or indoor plumbing. These units are removed from the short-term
supply of housing as the renovation costs are assumed to be cost
prohibitive.
Units Not Occupied by Renters or Owners. Generally,
homes that are used as a second residence or vacation home. This
is an important issue in many smaller towns and cities that draw
tourists and recreational visitors.
Walkability. A measure developed by the EPA based on
intersection density (higher intersection density correlates
with more walk trips), proximity to transit stops, diversity of
employment types (strong mix of retail, office, industrial), and
mix of occupied housing types.
YIMBY. An acronym that stands for Yes In My Backyard. The
term is often used to stand in stark contrast to perceived NIMBY
opposition to local proposals and initiatives.
