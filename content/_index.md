# Oregon Housing Project

Oregon isn't building enough housing, its housing is too expensive, and at least some of Oregon's regulatory approach is counter-productive. The mission of the Oregon Housing Project is to provide an in-depth exploration of the topic that's accessible to many.

## About The Oregon Housing Project {#about}

The mission of the Oregon Housing Project is to explore the topic of housing in Oregon at depth in a way that makes the topic accessible to more people. When it presents analysis, the project is biased towards these opinions:

* Oregon isn't building enough housing.
* Oregon's housing is too expensive.
* At least some of Oregon's regulatory approach is counter-productive; adding regulation paradoxically slows the rate of building and/or makes it more expensive.

The majority of the research depth focuses on Oregon. As appropriate, examples from other states are included as a point of reference.

## Governance

The project is maintained by [danielbachhuber](https://github.com/danielbachhuber).

## "LLM-Assisted"

Large Language Models (LLMs, or "AI") are much better or faster than humans in some ways. The Oregon Housing Project makes use of leading large language models like Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude to perform ongoing research, draft articles, provide editing feedback, and generate infographics. All of the work product receives a human review before being published.

## Open Source

The Oregon Housing Project is an [open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/danielbachhuber/oregon-housing-project). In the context of the project, "open source" primarily means that the project aims to be as transparent as possible. You should be able to see the provenance for a given bit of information, or the discussion around it.

The project also welcomes contributions! Please [read the contribute page](/contribute) for more information.
