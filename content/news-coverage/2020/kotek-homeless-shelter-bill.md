# New Bill Seeks to Alleviate Oregon Homelessness Issue

House Speaker [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s [HB 4001](/legislation/2020/hb-4001) aims to streamline and fund construction of homeless shelters across Oregon, where more than 64 percent of people experiencing homelessness are unsheltered. The bill proposes $60 million in competitive grants to local governments and nonprofits, and would require local governments to allow emergency shelter siting on qualifying properties—including religious institution land—notwithstanding existing zoning restrictions. Kotek emphasized an "emergency mindset" approach to address the thousands of Oregonians living without shelter, though the bill faced concerns about local control over land use decisions.
