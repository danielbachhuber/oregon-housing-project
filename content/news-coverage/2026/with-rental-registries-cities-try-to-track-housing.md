# With rental registries, cities try to track housing and hold bad actors accountable

Cities across the United States are increasingly adopting rental registries to track housing data and enforce safety standards, with programs now operating in Denver, Cedar Rapids, Oakland, and other municipalities amid growing renter populations and concerns about corporate landlord accountability. These registries vary widely in scope—from basic property ownership tracking to mandatory licensing with regular inspections—but share the goal of addressing data gaps about who owns rental properties, monitoring rent trends, and ensuring habitability standards like working smoke detectors. While the National League of Cities provides model legislation and advocates like Allison Pretto of Oakland's Rent Adjustment Program cite benefits in understanding "rent increase trends, tenant turnover, geographic patterns," landlord groups such as the American Apartment Owners Association oppose registries as added costs that discourage investment and ultimately raise rents. The lack of a centralized national database makes it difficult to track which jurisdictions have registries, though CityHealth reported in 2023 that 17 of the nation's 75 largest cities have implemented registries with regular inspection requirements.
