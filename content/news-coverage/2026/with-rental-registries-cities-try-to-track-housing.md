Cities across the U.S. are increasingly adopting rental registries—from basic ownership tracking to mandatory licensing with inspections—to monitor rent trends, identify property owners, and enforce habitability standards, with programs now in Denver, Cedar Rapids, Oakland, and other municipalities. Advocates like Allison Pretto of Oakland's Rent Adjustment Program cite benefits in understanding "rent increase trends, tenant turnover, geographic patterns," while landlord groups such as the American Apartment Owners Association oppose registries as added costs that discourage investment and raise rents. CityHealth reported in 2023 that 17 of the nation's 75 largest cities have registries with regular inspection requirements, though no centralized national database exists for comprehensive tracking.
