Bandon has imposed a 120-day moratorium on new vacation rental applications to study their impact on local housing availability, as the coastal city faces a shortage of middle-market housing for professionals like doctors and teachers. A 2023 housing needs study projects Bandon will need over 500 new housing units in the next 20 years to serve its roughly 2,000 existing homes. The moratorium, which can be extended up to six months, allows city staff to evaluate whether current vacation rental policies align with projected housing needs, following similar measures adopted by other Oregon coastal communities.
