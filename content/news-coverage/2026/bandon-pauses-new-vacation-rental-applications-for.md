Bandon has implemented a 120-day moratorium on new vacation rental applications to study their impact on local housing availability, as the coastal city struggles with a shortage of middle-market housing for professionals like doctors and teachers. Mayor Mary Schamehorn and Community Development Director Jeff Mitchum explained that while the city already has regulations limiting vacation rentals—including a 30% cap in certain areas and requiring permits for properties near the coast—a 2023 housing needs study projects Bandon will need over 500 new housing units in the next 20 years to serve its roughly 2,000 existing homes. The moratorium, which can be extended up to six months, allows city staff to evaluate whether current vacation rental policies align with projected housing needs, mirroring similar strict caps adopted by other Oregon coastal communities like Tillamook, Lincoln, and Humboldt counties.
