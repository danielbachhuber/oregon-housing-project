The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is organizing a campaign calling for the removal of Sunstone Way's CEO Andy Goebels and two other executives following a whistleblower complaint alleging financial mismanagement, including profligate spending and contractor overpayments at the [Portland](/cities/portland)-area nonprofit shelter provider. The union, representing 130 Sunstone Way workers, has coordinated 200 letters to the organization's board and is planning a Feb. 24 rally amid concerns about staff cuts and the closure of the Market Street Shelter. Sunstone Way was Multnomah County's 11th-largest contractor in fiscal year 2024 but has recently lost major contracts, including the city's 100-bed pod village in Southwest Portland.
