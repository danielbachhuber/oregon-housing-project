U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, a Democrat representing Oregon's 5th Congressional District, launched her "K-30" agenda in West Linn on January 26, 2026, presenting a 16-bill package aimed at addressing affordability challenges facing young Oregonians in education, housing, and jobs. The housing proposals focus primarily on reducing development costs through federal grants and tax incentives, including a $1.5 billion grant program for developers, funding for standardized building plans through HUD, and a $200 million investment in residential construction training through the federal Jobs Corps program. Key workforce initiatives include creating a Rural Service and Workforce Corps offering student loan relief for workers in high-demand rural fields, providing federal tax incentives for the mass timber industry, and subsidizing child care costs for semiconductor facility workers through the CHIPS Child Care Act. While at least seven bills have bipartisan support, many proposals rely on federal agencies and programs that the Trump administration is actively seeking to eliminate, raising questions about their implementation prospects.
