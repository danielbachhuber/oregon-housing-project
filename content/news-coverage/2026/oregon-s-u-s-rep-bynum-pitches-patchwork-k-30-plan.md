U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum launched her "K-30" agenda on January 26, 2026, a 16-bill package targeting affordability challenges for young Oregonians in education, housing, and jobs. Key proposals include a $1.5 billion developer grant program, $200 million for residential construction training, rural student loan relief, federal tax incentives for mass timber, and subsidized child care for semiconductor workers. While at least seven bills have bipartisan support, many rely on federal agencies the Trump administration is actively seeking to eliminate.
