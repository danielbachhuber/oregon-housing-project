Oregon relaxed building codes after the 2020 Almeda Fire to ease rebuilding, but state officials and Energy Trust of Oregon used pandemic relief funds and doubled utility-funded incentives to encourage fire survivors to rebuild to current energy-efficiency standards instead. The approach proved successful in [Canby](/cities/canby)'s neighboring communities of Talent, Phoenix, and Ashland, where builder Suncrest Homes and others constructed 35 highly efficient, fire-resistant homes using triple-pane windows, improved insulation, and heat pumps, though manufactured home parks housing low-income and Latine residents have been slower to recover. State Rep. Pam Marsh, whose district includes the fire zone, says the "carrots-instead-of-sticks" strategy demonstrates how to rebuild more resiliently after disasters while meeting climate goals.
