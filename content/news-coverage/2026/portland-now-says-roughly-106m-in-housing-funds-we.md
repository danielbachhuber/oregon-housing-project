[Portland](/cities/portland) has found approximately $106 million in unspent Housing Bureau funds—far exceeding the $21 million initially reported in November—which City Administrator [Raymond Lee](/people/raymond-lee) attributed to the old government structure where bureaus accumulated program funding without reporting to city budget leaders. Despite optimism from Mayor [Keith Wilson](/people/keith-wilson) and other officials, the funds cannot simply cover the city's $67 million budget shortfall because each source has specific designated purposes. Lee said the issue appears unique to the Housing Bureau but pledged to closely analyze funds across all bureaus going forward.
