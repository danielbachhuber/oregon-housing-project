# Portland now says roughly $106M in housing funds went unspent

[Portland](/cities/portland) has discovered approximately $106 million in previously unidentified funding within its Housing Bureau, more than five times the initial $21 million reported in November. City Administrator [Raymond Lee](/people/raymond-lee), hired in December, attributed the unspent funds to the old government system where bureaus accumulated program funding for future projects without reporting to city budget leaders—a practice that must change under Portland's new unified administrative government structure launched in January 2025. While Mayor [Keith Wilson](/people/keith-wilson) and City Council President Jamie Dunphy expressed optimism about the discovery, the funds cannot simply patch the city's $67 million budget shortfall since each funding source has specific designated purposes. Lee emphasized this appears to be an isolated incident unique to the Housing Bureau's circumstances, though he will closely analyze funds across all bureaus going forward.
