# Anderson Seeks Prevailing Wage Reforms to Reduce Housing Costs

Sen. Dick Anderson (R-Lincoln City), vice chair of the Oregon Senate Housing and Development Committee, is introducing [Senate Bill 1566](/legislation/2026/sb-1566) to modify Oregon's prevailing wage laws. The bill would clarify that commercial uses and adjacent infrastructure don't jeopardize affordability exemptions, allow up to 50% commercial ground-floor space, increase height exemptions from four to seven stories in certain counties, and prevent renovations of previously used buildings from triggering prevailing wage requirements. Anderson argues these changes are needed because current interpretations by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries have inflated project costs and stalled development, despite over $1 billion in state investment and Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s housing priorities.
