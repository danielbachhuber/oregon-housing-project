Sen. [Dick Anderson](/people/dick-anderson) (R-Lincoln City) is introducing [Senate Bill 1566](/legislation/2026/sb-1566) to reform Oregon's prevailing wage laws for housing projects, including clarifying affordability exemptions, allowing up to 50% commercial ground-floor space, raising height exemptions from four to seven stories, and exempting renovations of previously used buildings. Anderson says current interpretations by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries have inflated costs and stalled development, undermining over $1 billion in state investment and Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s housing priorities.
