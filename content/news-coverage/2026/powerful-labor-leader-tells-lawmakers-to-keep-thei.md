[SB 1566 (2026)](/legislation/2026/sb-1566), sponsored by [Dick Anderson](/people/dick-anderson) and [Vikki Breese-Iverson](/people/vikki-breese-iverson), would clarify prevailing wage laws to reduce costs for affordable housing and child care projects, but has stalled after powerful labor leader Robert Camarillo warned lawmakers not to pursue such reforms. The bill emerged from disputes over Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries interpretations that developers say have increased project costs by 10-20%, preventing child care facilities from being built in affordable housing developments, though unions argue the bill represents a "false choice" that would cut worker wages. Despite [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s housing emergency declaration, Democratic leadership has blocked the bill from advancing, highlighting the rift between affordable housing advocates and labor unions.
