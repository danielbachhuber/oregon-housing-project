# Oregon bill would require home insurers to consider wildfire prevention efforts

Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland, has introduced legislation that would require Oregon home insurers to factor in wildfire prevention efforts when setting premiums, following a Colorado model amid rising insurance costs that have increased over 27% since 2020. The bill mandates that insurers using catastrophic modeling demonstrate their formulas account for homeowner investments in fire-resistant improvements and defensible landscaping meeting standards from the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, with rate-setting information filed confidentially with the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. Golden previously championed a controversial wildfire risk map that was later repealed, though insurers revealed they relied on their own risk modeling rather than state maps. While industry representatives from the Northwest Insurance Council expressed cautious support, they noted the bill needs refinement regarding the scope of premium discounts and specific prevention actions that would qualify for incentives.
