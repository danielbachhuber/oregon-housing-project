Oregon Sen. Jeff Golden has introduced a bill requiring home insurers to factor in wildfire prevention efforts—such as fire-resistant improvements and defensible landscaping—when setting premiums, following a Colorado model as insurance costs have risen over 27% since 2020. Insurers using catastrophic modeling would need to show their formulas account for these homeowner investments, with rate-setting information filed confidentially with the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. Industry representatives from the Northwest Insurance Council expressed cautious support but said the bill needs refinement on the scope of discounts and which prevention actions would qualify.
