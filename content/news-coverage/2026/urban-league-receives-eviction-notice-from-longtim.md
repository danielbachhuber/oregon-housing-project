The Urban League of Portland received an eviction notice from its landlord, Portland Community Reinvestment Initiatives (PCRI), requiring the nonprofit to vacate its longtime headquarters at 10 N Russell St. by March 1, 2026. The dispute stems from disagreements over building conditions and a 2006 agreement in which PCRI bought the building to bail out Urban League financially, with Urban League claiming there was an understanding the building would eventually be sold back. Urban League's general counsel urged [Portland](/cities/portland) Mayor [Keith Wilson](/people/keith-wilson) and City Council to intervene, calling the eviction "retaliatory" after Urban League publicly highlighted the building's disrepair and noting PCRI received $1.5 million in city loan dollars.
