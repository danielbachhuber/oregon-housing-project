# Portland Sitting on $106 Million in Unspent Housing Dollars

City Administrator [Raymond C. Lee III](/people/raymond-lee) disclosed on February 6, 2026, that [Portland](/cities/portland)'s [Housing Bureau](/cities/portland/portland-housing-bureau) has accumulated $106 million in unspent funds, far exceeding the $21 million initially believed to be in bureau coffers. City Councilor [Loretta Smith](/people/loretta-smith) had earlier revealed that the number had grown from $21 million to about $40 million, but the total surged to $106 million as Lee's office conducted a full accounting of "previously unbudgeted housing funds" since November. Lee's [detailed memo](/cities/portland/files/2026-02-06-unbudgeted-housing-balances-memo.pdf) explained where the money was found and how it may be legally spent, but offered little explanation of how so much money accumulated without being budgeted, suggesting the situation "reflects the city's ongoing shift from bureaus and offices developing budgets independently to the city of Portland managing its finances holistically under our new form of government." City councilors have been demanding answers about how the Housing Bureau managed to stockpile such significant revenue while [Portland](/cities/portland) faces an ongoing housing crisis.
