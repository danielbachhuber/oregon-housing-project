A whistleblower complaint alleges that Sunstone Way CEO Andy Goebels charged bar tabs totaling $257 to the nonprofit shelter provider on February 21, 2025, potentially violating Multnomah County contracting rules that prohibit using Homeless Services Department funding for alcohol expenses. Former finance director Kate Fulton, who filed the complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court after being terminated, documented credit card charges from Paddy's Bar & Grill, while three anonymous former employees described a "boozy culture" including weekly "Thirsty Thursday" gatherings at [Portland](/cities/portland) bars. The allegations raise questions about compliance with both county funding requirements and Sunstone Way's own employee handbook, which prohibits charging alcohol to the organization except under specific circumstances.
