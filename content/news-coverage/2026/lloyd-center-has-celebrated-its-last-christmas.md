Lloyd Center mall in Northeast [Portland](/cities/portland) is closing permanently after this past holiday season, with developers planning to redevelop the 18-block site into a mixed-use neighborhood with housing, retail, transit connections, and public open space. Tenant Matt Henderson of Virtua art gallery is leading a Save Lloyd campaign with over 5,000 petition signatures, arguing the mall has experienced a creative rebirth with businesses like Floating World Comics and Star Tropics Pinball Museum. A design commission hearing is scheduled for February 5 to allow public testimony on the redevelopment plans.
