Lloyd Center mall in Northeast [Portland](/cities/portland) is set to close permanently after this past holiday season, with developers Urban Renaissance Group and KKR Real Estate Finance Trust planning to redevelop the 18-block site into a mixed-use neighborhood featuring affordable and market-rate housing, retail, transit connections, and 6 acres of public open space. While managing director Tom Kilbane frames the project as a new chapter for the historic 1960s-era mall, tenant Matt Henderson of Virtua art gallery is leading a Save Lloyd campaign that has gathered over 5,000 petition signatures, arguing that the mall has experienced a creative rebirth with businesses like Floating World Comics and Star Tropics Pinball Museum. The developers plan to give existing tenants at least three months' notice before closure, with a design commission hearing scheduled for February 5 to allow public testimony on the redevelopment plans.
