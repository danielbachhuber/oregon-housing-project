Oregon lawmakers advanced Senate Bill 1523, which would require landlords to offer paper-based alternatives for rental applications, rent payments, and keys to accommodate renters who lack access to or familiarity with technology. Housing advocates testified that online-only portals create barriers for older adults, low-income renters, and people with disabilities, with nearly 1 in 4 seniors lacking smartphones, while landlords opposed the bill citing concerns about processing delays and inefficiency. The bill addresses a gap in the Oregon Fair Housing Act, which doesn't cover age or income-based accommodations despite existing disability protections.
