# Developers of Lloyd Center send master plan – absent ice rink – to city for consideration

Developers Urban Renaissance Group and KKR Real Estate have submitted a master plan to [Portland](/cities/portland)'s Design Commission to demolish the Lloyd Center mall and replace it with a mixed-use development featuring housing, retail, and park spaces—but notably excluding the iconic year-round ice rink that has existed since 1960. At a public hearing Thursday, dozens of community members testified against the demolition, emphasizing the mall's role as a multicultural gathering space and expressing concerns about the loss of accessible indoor recreation, while some raised issues about leaving communities of color out of the planning process and invoking the city's troubled history with urban renewal in historically Black neighborhoods. City staff are recommending approval of the plan, which developers say will provide "thousands of new housing units, affordable and market rate," though Urban Renaissance Group has indicated the current mall will close by year's end regardless. The Design Commission is accepting public comments through at least February 13 before voting on whether to approve the redevelopment plan.
