Developers Urban Renaissance Group and KKR have submitted a master plan to [Portland](/cities/portland)'s Design Commission to demolish Lloyd Center mall and replace it with mixed-use housing, retail, and park spaces, notably excluding the iconic ice rink that has stood since 1960. Dozens of community members testified against the demolition, citing the mall's role as a multicultural gathering space and criticizing the exclusion of communities of color from the planning process. The Design Commission is accepting public comments through at least February 13 before voting on the plan.
