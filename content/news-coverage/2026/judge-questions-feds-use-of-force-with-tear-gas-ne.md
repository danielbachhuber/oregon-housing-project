A federal judge is considering a preliminary injunction sought by [Portland](/cities/portland) residents and affordable housing nonprofit Reach Community Development to restrict federal agents' use of tear gas and chemical munitions near an ICE facility, after residents reported severe health effects from repeated exposure during immigration protests. U.S. District Judge Amy M. Baggio questioned Justice Department attorneys over inconsistent reports about force used against protesters and requested additional documents on use-of-force policies, while residents testified about debilitating symptoms including migraines, wheezing, and panic attacks. The hearing follows a separate temporary restraining order issued by another federal judge in February 2026 that barred agents from using less-lethal munitions against protesters without an imminent threat, after agents deployed tear gas against crowds including children and seniors.
