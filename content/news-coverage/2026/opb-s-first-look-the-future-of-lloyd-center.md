The new owners of [Portland](/cities/portland)'s Lloyd Center, Urban Renaissance Group and KKR Real Estate, unveiled plans to demolish the historic mall and its iconic ice rink to build a mixed-use development featuring park space, walking paths, housing, and businesses. At a public hearing Thursday before Portland's Design Commission, dozens of community members submitted comments opposing the demolition, defending the importance of the mall and year-round ice rink to those who visit and work there daily.
