The new owners of [Portland](/cities/portland)'s Lloyd Center, Urban Renaissance Group and KKR Real Estate, unveiled plans to demolish the historic mall and its iconic ice rink, which has operated since 1960, to make way for a mixed-use development featuring park space, walking paths, housing, and businesses. At a public hearing Thursday before Portland's Design Commission, dozens of community members submitted comments opposing the demolition, defending the importance of the current mall and year-round ice rink to those who visit and work there daily. The master plan represents a significant redevelopment of a major Portland landmark, though the proposal has generated substantial public opposition focused on preserving the existing structure and its recreational amenities.
