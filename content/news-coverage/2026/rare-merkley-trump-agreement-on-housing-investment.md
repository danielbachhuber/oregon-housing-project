# Rare Merkley, Trump agreement on housing investments

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley has emerged as Congress's leading advocate for restricting hedge fund purchases of single-family homes, proposing legislation in October 2024 that would ban such ownership and force large investors to sell their inventory to first-time homebuyers or face substantial tax penalties. His position found unexpected support from President Donald Trump, who expressed backing for limiting institutional investor purchases in January 2025, though the administration has since remained silent on the issue. While institutional investors may account for less than 5% of home purchases, their ability to pay significantly higher prices than typical buyers is seen as driving up housing costs, particularly in markets where homes sell for over half a million dollars. Nevada's legislature recently considered similar restrictions through Senate Bill 10, which narrowly failed, and Oregon lawmakers could take up comparable measures as early as the 2025 legislative session.
