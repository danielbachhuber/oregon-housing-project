U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley proposed legislation in October 2024 to ban hedge fund ownership of single-family homes and force large investors to sell to first-time homebuyers or face tax penalties, a stance that received unexpected support from President Donald Trump in January 2025. Though institutional investors account for less than 5% of home purchases, their ability to pay well above typical prices is seen as driving up housing costs. Nevada's legislature recently considered similar restrictions through Senate Bill 10, which narrowly failed, and Oregon lawmakers could take up comparable measures as early as 2025.
