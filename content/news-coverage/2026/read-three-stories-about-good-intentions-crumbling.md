This article introduces a special edition examining three housing and development challenges across [Portland](/cities/portland) neighborhoods, illustrating how local policy decisions create unintended consequences beyond the downtown core. Editor Aaron Mesh highlights stories about a low-income apartment building in Eliot where city housing authority reforms have led to deteriorating conditions, preservationists blocking the demolition of Cleveland High School in Hosford-Abernethy, and disputes over new fourplex development in the Ashcreek neighborhood. The piece argues that while viral moments downtown capture national attention, these quieter neighborhood dramas reveal the complex realities of Portland's housing crisis and urban development struggles.
