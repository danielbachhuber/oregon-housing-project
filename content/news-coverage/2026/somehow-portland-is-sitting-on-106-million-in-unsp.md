[Portland](/cities/portland)'s Housing Bureau has $106 million in unspent housing funds, far exceeding the $21 million initially reported and the $40 million figure disclosed by City Councilor [Loretta Smith](/people/loretta-smith). City Administrator [Raymond Lee](/people/raymond-lee) revealed the total in a Friday memo but offered little explanation for how such a large sum accumulated without being used to address the housing crisis. City councilors are now demanding answers about how the bureau failed to budget and spend these resources.
