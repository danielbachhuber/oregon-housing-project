[Portland](/cities/portland)'s Housing Bureau has been found to be sitting on $106 million in unspent housing funds, a dramatic increase from the $21 million initially reported and far more than the $40 million figure disclosed by City Councilor [Loretta Smith](/people/loretta-smith) earlier in the week. City Administrator [Raymond Lee](/people/raymond-lee) revealed the new total in a Friday memo that detailed where the "previously unbudgeted housing funds" were found but offered little explanation for how such a large sum accumulated without being deployed to address the city's housing crisis. The revelation has sparked demands for answers from city councilors about how the bureau, responsible for funding affordable housing and renter protections, failed to budget and spend these resources under the city's previous system of independent bureau budgeting.
