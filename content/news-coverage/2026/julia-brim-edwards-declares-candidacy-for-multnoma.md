Multnomah County Commissioner Julia Brim-Edwards announced her candidacy for county chair, challenging Commissioner Shannon Singleton to succeed Jessica Vega Pederson, who is not seeking reelection. Brim-Edwards, a former Nike executive who won a special election representing Southeast [Portland](/cities/portland) in 2023, has been critical of the county's handling of homelessness and drug deflection programs, promising "greater urgency and action" to achieve measurable results. She secured endorsements from [Portland](/cities/portland) Mayor [Keith Wilson](/people/keith-wilson) and several centrist City Council members, contrasting with Singleton's more progressive support base.
