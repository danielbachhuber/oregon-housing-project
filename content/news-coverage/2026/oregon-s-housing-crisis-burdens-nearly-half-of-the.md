[Gov. Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) and state lawmakers are addressing Oregon's affordable housing crisis with hundreds of millions in funding and new programs, including legislation to expand mobile home communities for older residents. Half of Oregon's 620,000 renting households are "rent burdened" (paying over 30% of pretax income on housing), with 1 in 4 spending 50% or more, according to a 2021 Oregon Law Center report. Coastal counties face particular challenges as seasonal tourism reduces available housing for lower-wage hospitality workers, prompting Tillamook County to restrict new rentals in 2023 to just 1% annual growth.
