# Homeless Oregon youth got $1,000 a month for two years. Most found housing after

The Oregon Department of Human Services' pilot Direct Cash Transfer Plus program provided 120 homeless youth ages 18-24 with $1,000 monthly for two years, resulting in 94% of participants securing housing by the program's conclusion in January 2025. Operating in Multnomah, Clackamas, and Deschutes counties, the program paired cash assistance with case management and a one-time $3,000 enrichment fund, helping participants improve financial literacy and escape unstable situations. Oregon became the second state after New York City to implement such a program, and a second cohort began receiving payments in September with expanded coverage to Jackson County, funded by legislative appropriations and a $1 million grant from the Oregon Community Foundation.
