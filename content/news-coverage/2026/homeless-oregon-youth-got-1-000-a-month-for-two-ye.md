Oregon's Direct Cash Transfer Plus program gave 120 homeless youth ages 18-24 $1,000 monthly for two years, and 94% secured housing by the program's end in January 2025. The program, operating in Multnomah, Clackamas, and Deschutes counties, paired cash assistance with case management and a one-time $3,000 enrichment fund. Oregon became the second state after New York City to implement such a program, and a second cohort began receiving payments in September with expanded coverage to Jackson County.
