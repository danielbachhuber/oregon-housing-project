A group of nonprofits, including the Sunnyside Shower Project, has taken over the former Sunnyside United Methodist Church in [Portland](/cities/portland) to provide community services ranging from youth basketball to free showers, clothes, and hygiene supplies for unhoused residents three days a week. Director Lindsay Cogan-Sant says the project, founded by Hannah Wallace during the pandemic, now relies on 70 volunteers who help connect housed and unhoused neighbors to resources they need. The collaborative effort has transformed the historic building into a community hub serving residents who have been coming to the space for decades.
