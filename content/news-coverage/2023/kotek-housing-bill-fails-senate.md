# Even After She Teamed Up With Senate Republicans, Gov. Tina Kotek Suffered Her Biggest Loss of the Legislative Session

Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s priority housing bill [HB 3414](/legislation/2023/hb-3414) failed in the Oregon Senate by a single vote on the final day of the 2023 session—killed by her fellow Democrats rather than Republicans. The bill would have allowed cities to quickly expand their urban growth boundaries by up to 150 acres to boost housing production toward Kotek's goal of 36,000 units per year. All eight Senate Republicans present voted for the bill, but only seven of seventeen Democrats supported it, with environmental groups and the League of Oregon Cities leading opposition over concerns about land use sprawl. The failure illustrated the escalating conflict between Oregon's 50-year-old land use planning system, established by [SB 100 (1973)](/legislation/1973/sb-100), and the urgent need to build more housing faster.
