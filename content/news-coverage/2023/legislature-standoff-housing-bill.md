# Standoff over housing bill keeps Oregon Legislature from adjournment

A standoff over Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s [HB 3414](/legislation/2023/hb-3414) kept the Oregon Legislature from adjourning as scheduled, with disagreements over how to accelerate housing construction pitting housing advocates against environmentalists and local governments. The bill, which Kotek considered a key tool to increase housing supply by allowing faster urban growth boundary expansions, faced strong opposition from groups like 1000 Friends of Oregon and the Oregon League of Conservation Voters, who called it "the most significant assault on the land use planning system" in 30 years. The controversy highlighted the tension between Oregon's need to build 140,000 more housing units to meet current demand and preserve the landmark land use system established in 1973.
