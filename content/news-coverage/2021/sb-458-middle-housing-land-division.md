# SB 458 passes Oregon Legislature

The Oregon Legislature passed [SB 458](/legislation/2021/sb-458) with overwhelming bipartisan support (54-2 in the House, 25-4 in the Senate), allowing lot divisions for middle housing that enable duplexes, triplexes, and other units to be sold individually. Introduced at the request of Habitat for Humanity and sponsored by Senators [Lew Frederick](/people/lew-frederick) (D) and [Tim Knopp](/people/tim-knopp) (R), the bill complements [HB 2001 (2019)](/legislation/2019/hb-2001) by creating homeownership opportunities for middle housing. Shannon Vilhauer, Executive Director of Habitat Oregon, emphasized the bill's goal to "increase the supply of homeownership opportunities that are entry-level and affordable around the state."
