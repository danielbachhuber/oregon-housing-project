A newly released report from the Oregon Department of Housing & Community Services reveals that Oregon's population grew by three residents for every new housing unit between 2015 and 2019, significantly exceeding national averages and driving the state to rank third nationally for homelessness per capita. Governor [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek) set an ambitious target of 36,000 new housing units annually through [Executive Order 23-04](/legislation/2023/eo-23-04), but Oregon is projected to permit only approximately 12,000 units in 2024, falling dramatically short despite record public investment and zoning reforms. Kotek's proposed 2025-27 budget allocates $1.4 billion toward housing initiatives, including $880 million for affordable housing bonds and $100 million for infrastructure. The report identifies two potentially favorable conditions: a robust construction industry and slower population growth, though the latter reflects housing affordability challenges rather than positive development.
