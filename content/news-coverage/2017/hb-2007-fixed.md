# SUCCESS! HB 2007 Has Been Fixed!

After [HB 2007](/legislation/2017/hb-2007)—Representative [Tina Kotek](/people/tina-kotek)'s middle housing bill that would have mandated duplexes statewide—was killed in the Senate due to concerns about demolitions and neighborhood impacts, a coalition of preservation organizations helped craft replacement legislation. The new bill SB 1051-8 removed the controversial mandate to allow duplexes in all single-family zones while still advancing housing production goals. The experience with HB 2007 proved to be a "trial run" that helped housing advocates identify opponents and refine their approach, ultimately paving the way for the successful passage of [HB 2001](/legislation/2019/hb-2001) two years later.
